However, I found the book rather boring and lackluster when comparing the two. It seemed to begin somewhere in the middle of an undefined plot (plot??) and worked it's way to the end, which I must admit was surprising. Usually the book is better than the movie, but in this case the reverse is true. If you've seen the movie, don't expect to find any similarity between the two. I really found the book to be a little confusing and boring. The only thing I recognized was the giant robot (named Gnut instead of Gort). I was disappointed.",Not near as good as the movie,2,2016-06-26

That's helpful for those who are forgetful, but annoying to those who remember. It could have been half its length if carefully edited. Its extensive list of sources belies the simplicity of the prose, however, so while it is simple and easy to understand, apparently it is backed up with research. I wish that research were integrated into the book to enhance its credibility and to show where studies were being cited. If you're completely new to the world of glycemic load, this is a good start.

3,2,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000JMKQKS,"When I found how much I gained form the Jason Fung information I decided that I should do some studying on other diet related theories that I had no knowledge of.  And as usual I went by the customer feedback on the amazon pages to quickly find the most valuable books to read on things like the paleo diet and the glycemic index stuff.
When I put in the search terms 'glyceimc index'  for Amazon books I was a bit dismayed to have a page come up with a dozen or so paperbacks that had names and covers appearing to all be in a series done identically. When I clicked on titles, and went right to the customer reviews, it seemed that all the customers had the same feeling about the books, as if they were nearly identical.  A few people thought what they got was all they would ever need to know, and these must have been people who did not have much information about the subject.
Others like me, who left reviews, had information on the subject and wanted something more in depth. These comments were that the lists with glycemic loads of various food were all about packaged foods that they had stopped eating long ago, as I had, and not whole foods. I also noticed that the lists of foods all seemed to be identical from some government source.
Comments by people who felt a book lacked certain things led me along to other titles they said were better. So in time I did get to a book that had a bit more than the other did, 'Glycemic Load Diet' by Robb Thompson.
Any book would give the basics, and the number of pages was also almost identical.  And the cover comments of how wonderful the book was, seemed to all be by authors of almost identical books. And each book seemed to have the last third be recipes.  Excuse me, but I have spices and ingredients thee authors never even heard of and cook healthy and very tasty meals  people are crazy for and I don't need a list of a dozen ingredients to measure and out in separate containers to mix in a special sequence. I grab stuff from where and there and put it all in one bowl, and if they had given me more glycemic numbers for real food it would have been a bit nicer for the diet thing, but otherwise still great.
And I have news for all these authors ALMOST NO ONE BUT ME AND A FEW OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWERS ACTUALLY COOKS WITH REAL FOOD ANYMORE.  Do they really think the fast food junkies in enough dietary trouble to buy their books is going to get all that stuff and measure it and make those time consuming dishes?  I don't think so.
And some of the numbers I question because, for example I gave up 99% of wheat in my diet years ago. And years ago I found that pastas made from things that were not grains, were not exactly like wheat pastas, but were pretty good. And I also noticed that they did not make my blood sugar reading so drastic as anything wheat would do. I realized that the pasta from beans and roots and  pumpkin were what the glycemic index was all about. Only the lists showed they had the name number as wheat pasta. So it sort of missed what we were hoping to learn from the lists.
I did get a number of important points out if the book. Fotr example, all the years of carb counting I read books that hinted alcohol did not have carbs as such, but anyone with sense would avoid it if all possible.  I believed that authors were just raining on the parade instead of saying 'GOOD NEWS, GET AS DRUNK AS YOU LIKE ON THIS DIET!!' the glycemic index I assume is the same in every book showed the same  < 'less than' sign it did for the meat and other protein foods as having no carbs to speak of . the text dais that alchhol could make you want to eat more, but that was all.  So let me give you the good news, you can get as drunk as you like on the diet!!  Now I don't drink often so when I do a very small amount works real good.  And given some very disturbing things happening at the time (what the I Ching calls 'misfortune from without', not something I caused to happen) and I was finding one a day of those little bud-a rama fake 8% margueritas for over a week  and binge watching historical costume Korean soap operas was making my life a lot less stressful.
I did get a few things out of this book, but it does not rise far above the rest of the assembly line to serve a new audience. If there is an author out there who has some real in depth information and insight on glycemic index stuff, I, and at least several dozen others reviewing similar books did not find that person.
While the glycemic diet is just another Atkin's  spin off, there are some things we did not know before that  that make it a bit easier to stay on, such as eating a bit of sweet at the end of the meal.  This I had already found helped to get my blood sugar to go down more after a meal.  I wish there had been more detail about that.  And since I did skip some parts perhaps there is.
Right now I am an annoyed person and it is not easy to clear my mind to read books and put other thoughts aside. But then I think most people who are looking for a book of this kind are the same way.  And those of us who had to go total zero carbs for a couple weeks on Atkin's to get purple in the dig stick, may not do so well with the sweet at the end thing.
Back wen we read Atkin's, we got some real info and most of us lost a lot of weight that stayed off for pretty long.  It remains to be seen whether there is any startling results to be happy about from dealing with the glycemic index.",not as much helpful information as i had hoped for,8,2016-10-06

5,5,A2X4AEWNWCA1NX,B000VDUWMC,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.

Why is economic development so uneven around the world?

Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? [W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? [W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel? In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a unified synthesisa unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.

Academic critics howled

However, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel:

  They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Thats nitpicking, as far as Im concerned. And many of these errors could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories.

  Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamonds book, its insulting to the reader.

  The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of environmental determinism. Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factorsbut he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything weve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined.

  There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didnt) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamonds critics never read the book.

  However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, thats no error. He didn't pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.

Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadnt cited their own specialized research?

The roots of academic criticism

Though the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamonds expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. Its not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as not serious. And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.

A wealth of meaning behind the title

To understand where the academic critics went wrong, its useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. The immediate reasons for Pizarros success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.

Diamonds argument in a nutshell

In a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?' To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. Its unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the civilization in which we live.

Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africaand the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United Statesimpeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the guns, germs, and steel that made Eurasian dominance possibleand dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.

Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesnt make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, youll find this book highly rewarding.",The only persuasive explanation for the wealth gap between the West and the rest,177,2017-01-24
6,5,A3SC0J7CHHHHKH,B000VMBYL6,I have lost 22 pounds in 6 weeks by using the recipes in this book and following the guidelines.  Awesome!  I have recommended to everyone I know who is trying to lose some weight.  It works!,Awesome! I have recommended to everyone I know who ...,12,2016-10-16
7,1,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000VMBYL6,"Having just reviewed diet books that turned out to be little more than fluff,  I got very angry when I expected this book to deliver some real information that would be of value to helping me reverse diabetes, after making a good start on doing it after finding the Jason Fung YouTube videos and book.
The trouble begins on page 5 when we are shown the first of a set of graphs. All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.
Now on page 16 you are told that you can figure your body mass index on the chart 2.4.  but the chart has only height and weight boxes. Nowhere in the book are you told what to do with the height and weight figures tocompute your body mass.
The back cover says 'charts to determine your insulin resistance and check progress'  implying you will find this information in the book.  But all you get is a statement on page 27 directing you to go to a web site to do an online  'insulin resistance test'.
Having found the easy and dramatically effective information from Jason Fung that got my blood glucose reading down over 100 points in 3 days doing his;mini fasts' of no eating between meals for as little time as 5 or 6 hours, I was surprised to find on page 46 of this book the advise:
'Do eat frequent small meals, at 2-5 hour intervalsgoing long periods of time without eating only encourages more fat storage'
the book has pages with day 1,2 ND 3, Ec with about 10 blank lines to chart progress. You are directed to page 39 for information how to do this. Page 39 shows a representation of a scale with one or two circles on one side and one or two squares on the other, representing 'linking and balancing'  protein and carbs.  If you eat two each, then you have one rectangle of 'foods such as vegetables'  if you have one each you have two rectangles.
While there is a lot of test about eating fats,  the traditional last third of the book giving recipes stresses ingredients such as fat free margarine, cheese, and whipped topping '  and using 'sugar free gelatin (full of wholesome sugar substitute we were warned about earlier, and artificial color and flavor)  while we are told people who eat more dairy have less insulin resistance, but are these people eating dairy altered to remove fat ?
The book claims things such as that eating fat makes you crave more food, that you can not do anything to lose weight around your weight, and that  eating wheat is just fine, and wheat s the same as any other carbs.
I will stop here and address these last few 'facts'. This book suggests a diet very similar to what I ate all my life and got fat on, and could never lose weight until I found Atkin's.  eating more NATURAL  fats, and especially in meat, what we call fat but is actually connective tissue such as the thick skin on pork shoulder,  is what kept me from being hungry most of my life-and I almost never get hungry. It also contributed greatly to my regrowing cartlidge in a 'bone to bone' knee I was as told I could not return to normal by a doctor wanting to put in an artificial knee.
As for waist size, my personal research taught me that taking 2-4 grams of potassium citrate  twice a day ( intended to remove lead or other heavy metals from your system in 6 weeks, you will lose not weight but trim 2 sizes off your waist size in a week.  I gave a lot of friends I  knew at UFO conference the stuff  andevery one who took it  had their pants falling off by the end of the week.
As for exercise, I  also worked construction as a pipefitter for a few years and while eating a diet of protein and natural rbs similar to their 'pared' amounts touted in this book and I never lost an ounce.  In fact I never lost any weight in my life except on the Atkin's diet by first cutting back to zero carbs for a couple weeks, and adding very few back if I wanted to keep it off.
And at a time when most researchers are finding wheat is a big contributor to many of the difficult to solve health problems too many people are plagued with, it is a mystery to figure out  how these authors continue to think that eating wheat is just fine.
Anyone with health difficulties needs to cut out wheat FIRST  to find out if it is a problem for them because if it is, nothing else you do will ever work.
I believe this book tells the kind of advise that keeps people from ever getting better. I can not trust their claims that they got so many people better with what they claim works, and if I have to go on line to take tests, why buy the book?
If anyone is concerned with insulin resistance  go to YouTube and watch Jason Fung videos and get his book for results that make a difference  as dramatic as I only ever got from Atkin's before.
Most people who READ to learn about health problems will be smart enough by now to know to be very suspicious about the confusing advice given as fact in this book.","Misleading, Confusing and Inaccurate Information-",5,2016-10-06

33,1,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000VMBYL6,"Having just reviewed diet books that turned out to be little more than fluff,  I got very angry when I expected this book to deliver some real information that would be of value to helping me reverse diabetes, after making a good start on doing it after finding the Jason Fung YouTube videos and book.
The trouble begins on page 5 when we are shown the first of a set of graphs. All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.
Now on page 16 you are told that you can figure your body mass index on the chart 2.4.  but the chart has only height and weight boxes. Nowhere in the book are you told what to do with the height and weight figures tocompute your body mass.
The back cover says 'charts to determine your insulin resistance and check progress'  implying you will find this information in the book.  But all you get is a statement on page 27 directing you to go to a web site to do an online  'insulin resistance test'.
Having found the easy and dramatically effective information from Jason Fung that got my blood glucose reading down over 100 points in 3 days doing his;mini fasts' of no eating between meals for as little time as 5 or 6 hours, I was surprised to find on page 46 of this book the advise:
'Do eat frequent small meals, at 2-5 hour intervalsgoing long periods of time without eating only encourages more fat storage'
the book has pages with day 1,2 ND 3, Ec with about 10 blank lines to chart progress. You are directed to page 39 for information how to do this. Page 39 shows a representation of a scale with one or two circles on one side and one or two squares on the other, representing 'linking and balancing'  protein and carbs.  If you eat two each, then you have one rectangle of 'foods such as vegetables'  if you have one each you have two rectangles.
While there is a lot of test about eating fats,  the traditional last third of the book giving recipes stresses ingredients such as fat free margarine, cheese, and whipped topping '  and using 'sugar free gelatin (full of wholesome sugar substitute we were warned about earlier, and artificial color and flavor)  while we are told people who eat more dairy have less insulin resistance, but are these people eating dairy altered to remove fat ?
The book claims things such as that eating fat makes you crave more food, that you can not do anything to lose weight around your weight, and that  eating wheat is just fine, and wheat s the same as any other carbs.
I will stop here and address these last few 'facts'. This book suggests a diet very similar to what I ate all my life and got fat on, and could never lose weight until I found Atkin's.  eating more NATURAL  fats, and especially in meat, what we call fat but is actually connective tissue such as the thick skin on pork shoulder,  is what kept me from being hungry most of my life-and I almost never get hungry. It also contributed greatly to my regrowing cartlidge in a 'bone to bone' knee I was as told I could not return to normal by a doctor wanting to put in an artificial knee.
As for waist size, my personal research taught me that taking 2-4 grams of potassium citrate  twice a day ( intended to remove lead or other heavy metals from your system in 6 weeks, you will lose not weight but trim 2 sizes off your waist size in a week.  I gave a lot of friends I  knew at UFO conference the stuff  andevery one who took it  had their pants falling off by the end of the week.
As for exercise, I  also worked construction as a pipefitter for a few years and while eating a diet of protein and natural rbs similar to their 'pared' amounts touted in this book and I never lost an ounce.  In fact I never lost any weight in my life except on the Atkin's diet by first cutting back to zero carbs for a couple weeks, and adding very few back if I wanted to keep it off.
And at a time when most researchers are finding wheat is a big contributor to many of the difficult to solve health problems too many people are plagued with, it is a mystery to figure out  how these authors continue to think that eating wheat is just fine.
Anyone with health difficulties needs to cut out wheat FIRST  to find out if it is a problem for them because if it is, nothing else you do will ever work.
I believe this book tells the kind of advise that keeps people from ever getting better. I can not trust their claims that they got so many people better with what they claim works, and if I have to go on line to take tests, why buy the book?
If anyone is concerned with insulin resistance  go to YouTube and watch Jason Fung videos and get his book for results that make a difference  as dramatic as I only ever got from Atkin's before.
Most people who READ to learn about health problems will be smart enough by now to know to be very suspicious about the confusing advice given as fact in this book.","Misleading, Confusing and Inaccurate Information-",5,2016-10-06

66,3,A1J3CQAW3A4XHF,B001VLXML6,"About the Author
Jeri Smith-Ready has been writing fiction since the night she had her first double espresso. A steady stream of caffeine has resulted in twelve published novels for teens and adults, including RT Reviewers Choice-winning fantasy EYES OF CROW; as well as the PRISM award-winning WICKED GAME and SHADE. Her most recent release is the YA contemporary novel THIS SIDE OF SALVATION, which Booklist called a ""smart, unpredictable, and well-rounded tale"" in its starred review.

Jeri lives in the rolling hills of Maryland with her husband and two cats, who often play tag-team ""sit in the author's lap and keep her from writing."" (The cats, that is, not the husband. Though actually...) When not writing, she's either out running or on Twitter.

I haven't read Jeri Smith-Ready before and this was an introduction to the series, which in all honesty was a great introduction. I'm really looking forward to exploring more of this series. I haven't had much exposure to current adult dystopian so it should be a treat.
Plot Summary: Elysia is living in what's left of Baltimore. Seven years ago there was a great `Collapse' and mankind was returned to the dark-age, but with automatic weapons at their disposal. Gasoline is worth killing for, riots start whenever food appears, and money is worthless. Her former best friend, Darien, steps in just when Elysia is cornered for stealing a bag of apples. Together they escape Baltimore and Darien wants to know if Elysia is still being called by her animal spirit. He wants to convince Elysia to give their relationship a chance, and follow their inner animal guides to find a new beginning for mankind.

I was pressed for time today, so I decided to read this freebie novella I downloaded for my Kindle. It is the prequel story to Jeri Smith-Ready's Aspect of Crow Trilogy, of which I have read the first book, Eyes Of Crow (Aspect of Crow Trilogy). I had assumed this trilogy was based on a pure fantasy construct, but actually it's a tale set on Earth far into the future. This prequel novella tells the story of how our current civilization collapsed, and the group of people who became ancestors to the animal spirit followers in the Aspect of Crow Trilogy.

In general I'm not a short story fan, but within a limited number of pages Smith-Ready wrote a complete tale with a start, middle, end, and a romance to boot. Unfortunately we are not privy to whatever caused the collapse of societies' modern infrastructure, and we're only treated to details about the aftermath. Still, it's a good little story for anyone who wants to read, or has already read, this series.",Three Stars,2,2016-02-11
67,4,A359U0JFFZ0Q04,B0023SDPS6,"THE COLD DISH is the first in the LONGMIRE series. It's quite a bit different than the TV series.

First off, Walt is kind of a goofball, and Vic tolerates him more than respects him. That's probably not the case, but she calls him names like fat****. That would ordinarily get you fired in most sheriff's offices.

Henry is also bigger and seems to be a very good shot with a Sharp's rifle, the murder weapon in Walt's most recent case. Somebody is shooting four boys who were tried for raping Henry's niece, Melissa Little Bird. They were found guilty, but the judge gave them limited sentences in juvenile facilities.

Whoever is killing the boys is shooting them at a very long distance, 500 yards. Walt could make that shot, as could Henry, and Melissa's father. Lonnie, who's missing his legs, and Omar, a Buffalo Bill like character who's an expert on the Sharp's rifle.

In the middle of the book there's a kind of surprise. Walt is reflecting on his lifehe's met a woman, Vonnie, who seems very interested in a relationship. Then there's the surprise. Martha, Walt's deceased wife, didn't really love him. Walt stuck it out because of his daughter, who is now a lawyer who doesn't call her father often enough. I don't remember hearing that in the TV series. Vic is also enduring an unhappy marriage, and she cares about Walt more than she lets on.

There are some interesting minor characters: Lucian, the old sheriff, is living in a senior citizen's home. Walt plays chess with him once a week. In this book, Walt hires Lucian as a dispatcher for two days a week. He's an old-time western sheriff who sort of made his own rules as a case progressed, but Walt respects him and leans on him for advice. Turk is Lucian's nephew, an announced candidate for sheriff after Walt retires. Walt wants Vic to take his place.

THE COLD DISH is just another instance of the book being better than the TV show. Walt has a sense of humor in the book. He also has a great deal of respect for Native American spirituality. There's a scene where Henry is wounded and Walt has to carry him back to safety in the middle of a blizzard.  He almost freezes to death. He hears bells and sees ghostlike Cheyenne Indians who lead him out of danger, left with frost bitten ears and hands. You might want to read this section twice. I had no idea what was going on.

70,3,A3R6E2Z6NM2BKR,B0023SDPS6,This book is very well written but very confusing to read. It drowns itself in a litany of characters. The tv show made it easier for me to follow but I was a tad disappointed overall.,"Love the tv show, the book?",2,2017-12-30
71,2,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0023SDPS6,"I guess Ill be in the minority on this one. The Cold Dish was unimpressive to me, and seemed a bit of a chore to get through. I almost cried uncle and jumped ship on this one a few times, but tried my best to carry on and finish.

The Cold Dish is another example of why I prefer standalone books to long series. This book works at a slow crawl because it seems to be a pilot for the first episode of many, where we get to know all the characters, their background, etc. Problem is, many of the characters aren't very impressive, including old Walt himself, and they seem to overshadow the mystery to the point where you say Hey, isn't there a mystery to solve here?

Also, the way this book was written was annoying and distracting. For one thing, there was way too much excess back story and exposition and the plot is very plodding and slow. There are some minor details that seem to trudge on and on interminably.

Moreover, many of the characters are interchangeable and forgettable. Many have a sort of smart alleck-y way of speaking to each other and seem to try to one up each other with silly, crude comments. It also doesnt help that Walts love life is constantly being pushed into the narrative too. This was annoying too, and it seems silly/unrealistic that many of the female characters are all falling over for him.
Often in this book things and dialogue about something comes out of nowhere and you have zero reference to what they are referring to. In fact, you sort of forget that there is a murder investigation that needs to be solved because there are so many sidebars and unnecessary details, these doing little to give you insight to the characters.

And, then all the mysticism added in seemed a bit forced and trite.

The descriptions of the landscape of Wyoming and the setting are somewhat of a saving grace, but not enough to save the reading experience.

In short, sort of an unremarkable reading experience. I don't think Ill be continuing on to see what becomes of old Walt. It seems from some of the reviewers say that the series from A and E is actually better than the book. Not sure if this is the case, but maybe Ill try a few episodes and see.","Weak characters, slow plot, weak dialogue, overrated",2,2017-01-14
72,5,A16ZB0PR9V6TJ8,B0023SDPS6,"Yes this story won many awards and spawned a tv series. Even reading it over again it touches the heart in so many ways.  The first time to meet Walt Longmire, Henry Standing Bear, Vic, Lucian and all the characters of North central Wyoming. The descriptive prose is worth the trip, but the mystery is great.  Somebody is killing a gang of rapists and Walt must stop them even though most people feel the same way. But Walt is damaged goods himself and he meets a woman that could help him. If only he could climb out of his own depression long enough. The two threads of the story twine around and around pulling Walt away. Until we meet the old Cheyenne in a mythic masterpiece on a mountain side in a blizzard.  Some of the best poetic writing I have ever read. In the end you long for more and the Longmire series begins.  Too bad the tv series is not as good.  But the books are excellent one after the other.

I have to add that the story is all over central Wyoming and Montana. Some places do not exist. Others are miles away from each other. The reservation is in Montana. The roads have the wrong numbers. So don't worry about any of that. Just enjoy the story.",Great writing,5,2016-10-26

Im very happy with this introduction to the leopard people, kind of like getting your feet wet before jumping into the body of water to get used to it quickly.

Also, its become rather rare in the Feehan world as of late to really have an artist male lead who gets a little flustered when his art is brought up. It was cute and refreshing. The cover finally got something after years of just really not having anything and the cover is not as amazing as the German edition but would still make me grab the book off a shelf to read the back.

I thought I would want the blurb to be longer but in just those few sentences, the author grabs your attention. The writing drags you into the rain forest and I could see everything that was happening.

A little mystery and action to keep the story interesting but a good, slow read that doesnt overwhelm the reader and keeps a steady pace for the plot.

While she has courage, she goes from scrape to scrape and, when Rule asks her - no demanding from Rule! - not to do something, she just plows on like a 2 year old bent on exerting her will. It just gets old after awhile. That being said, the characterizations for Rule, Horry, Pel and Pom are delightful, and the solutions Pel comes up with to help Horry are just plain funny. As always, Heyer can write some hysterically funny lines and scenes. This book is more a romp than a romance, as Heyer doesn't give the lovers many reflective thoughts, but you can see that love is blooming quietly, behind the scenes.

Lucky for me I started this series at a time when I had no commitments and could devote all my time to reading.  When I was not reading, I was thinking about getting back to the books to find out what happened next. Now that I know what happens next, I can reread the books, slowly savoring the character development and descriptions.

I have listed these books in one review because they are essentially one story, starting with Taryn's finding a griffin egg as a child. When the egg hatches, she is at a loss to know how to care for it. Her search for knowledge eventually leads her to another world. She finds mythical creatures such as minotaurs, wizards, and centaurs, only they are fiercely protective of their land and not friendly to humans.

As she struggles to survive, protect her griffin, and learn how to survive in this strange world, she comes to a deeper understanding of herself and her place in this world.

The themes I have come to recognize in Smith's works are all there: a heroine in an unfriendly world, beauty-and-the-beast, and the importance of sex as a means of communication.

The adventures she goes on to save this baby griffin is so heartwarming. There are also some truly laugh out loud moments.

Well written with amazing insight of human nature. Fabulous world and character building. Lovable and hateful a like.

There are adult themes with mythological characters who possess animalistic morality. There some truly frightening things touched upon. Rape being one of them. They are handled very well in my opinion. These are things that exist in the very real world. If you have a problem with violence like this, then this may not be the series for you.

 The next reason I devoured the book so avidly included the fact that Josh Gates is well-educated, and that is obvious in his writing style, grammar and vocabulary. It's VERY refreshing for me to have to stop mid-page in order to look up a word definition.
  This book is loaded with historical facts plus anecdotes as well, and since Josh received his university degrees in archaeology and drama, these little tidbits of truth and cultural oral tradition  round out this book with candid photos of the crew and their exotic locales.

A few twists and tunes, and the characters are pretty well developed.

It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?

This book was a little slow paced, but not bad. The hero and the heroine were nice enough, but the conflict between will/they or won't/they got old fast and felt as if it was thrown in for the sake of having conflict in the story.  Again, this wasn't totally a deal breaker and I did enjoy the story, to a point. The opening scene with the heroine coming across the hero naked in a river was great, short and very erotic, so I had high hopes for this book.

The real problem and what killed the book for me was the over abundance of long, long, long, sex scenes. I wanted a romance book and some erotic sex scenes in it would have been fine, but I wanted a romance book. When I want erotica, I look for books in that genre, not in the romance genre. I thought to myself, ""How many pages does it take to have an orgasm? Get it on already so we can get back to the bloody story. You know, that thing that interrupts the sex scenes, the reason why I bought the book."" To be honest, there were more pages of story than pages of sex scenes, but my gosh, those sex scenes were interminably long. I got so bored, as in "" Lie back and think of England"" bored.

The sex scenes were not hot enough to satisfy those who want hot sex scenes, because they were pretty vanilla. They would be good for readers who like sex scenes that are a bit sensuous without getting overly graphic. This book is in the sweet romance category, other than the sex scenes. I'm sure that there are a lot of readers who would love this book and it definitely isn't a bad, poorly written work. I simply detest romance books with what I consider to be too large a ratio of sex scenes to storylines. Very subjective, I know, but that is how I feel. Those who share my tastes might want to avoid this book.

The heroine in this book was very unlikeable. She started out being selfish, greedy, and mean and she ended being selfish, greedy, and mean. There was no growth. Aiden was very much the same. They were the same and totally deserved each other. I was rooting for Pete to grow a pair and to just realize that she was not worthy of him, but it seemed like he just kept holding on, thinking that there was some goodness in her. It was a decent read, but left me unfulfilled. I read book 3 - No Regrets, and the title was true to the book. Daisy and Aiden had no regrets about anything that they had done and just kept on doing. I just felt like the lesson here was that power and money wins over love. I truly wanted Aiden to end up paralyzed, pissing in a bag and Daisy living in a trailer park - that would have been an HEA for me (lol).",Unlikeable Characters,2,2016-08-31

However, when you read the subsequent books you understand it as a prequel, not a stand alone. It makes sense that it is a bit weaker or underdeveloped and rushed.
The second book was really good. I loved all the drama. I picked it up at 1.30 am read till 7 am, slept for three hours then woke up to read for another 6 hours straight. I was engrossed with this novel! And unlike many romance books this was a novel. It was a full fledge story with a thorough plot and complex characters. It read kind of like a soap but I didn't mind.
I know a lot of people had a problem with the characters. They are not the stereotypical protagonist and antagonist or hero/heroine and villain characters. They have both qualities. But, I am okay with that.  I am not afraid of flawed, messy or non good guy characters.
It was a tad long and redundant in some places but overall it was a great read. I love this author!",Enjoyed,2,2016-01-13
112,5,A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,B004AE34PU,"Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY, originally published in 1942, is one of two classic mythological summaries most readily available to us today. The other (and older of the two) is by Thomas Bulfinch; it was published in the early 19th century and is commonly called BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY (a merger of three works originally published separately as THE AGE OF FABLE, THE AGE OF CHIVALRY, and LEGENDS OF CHARLEMAGNE). Both authors present a summary overview of myths once widely taught but now generally neglected. Bulfinch is much more extensive and includes numerous legends not covered by Hamilton, but the coverage by both of the Greek and Roman myths (for which the two authors are most famous) makes for particularly interesting comparison. Some prefer Hamilton's treatment; others prefer Bulfinch's. I personally prefer Hamilton's consistent use of distinct Greek and Roman names rather than Bulfinch's frequent and occasionally confusing use of Roman names to identify Greek entities. But I generally enjoy Bulfinch's slightly old-fashioned style of storytelling over Hamilton's (though, all things considered, hers is quite fine). Hamilton's work is still under copyright, and it is published only by Little, Brown. Thus, it is more expensive than Bulfinch's which, being in the public domain, is easily obtainable online for free or in very inexpensive editions by numerous ebook publishers.

Those who may own older paperback or hardcovered editions of Hamilton's work will discover the 2012 ebook replaces the magnificent artwork of Steele Savage with somewhat less majestic illustrations by Chris Wormell (though the list of illustration topics remains the same). The text remains unaltered, and the formatting is exquisite. There is an active TOC (here at the very end), but (disappointingly) no index in the ebook version. Overall, it is a very handsome ebook and a delight to read.

It is hard to imagine retelling the great myths in a manner more concisely informative than rendered here by Hamilton. Critical reviewers who claim she is too difficult or too dry are certainly entitled to their opinions, but given the nature of the material and the purpose of this book, I would respectfully disagree with them. There is, of course, no substitute for reading the full-length originals from which these great tales have been culled and summarized, but this is by far a much more convenient way to initially encounter them; that is why this book has been (or, at least, once was) heavily used in public schools in conjunction with teaching these timeless stories.

Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY belongs in the personal library of every literate person as an introduction to, summary of, and/or reminder of these Greek, Roman, and Norse myths. But for added insights and additional myths, I would encourage readers of it to also obtain and read BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY.",One of two classic summaries of timeless myths,41,2017-10-06

It was nice to see Sophie grow up and start to understand the world that she was thrust into.  But there were times that I just wanted to shake her (much like Beth wanted to) to wake up to what she was doing was not cool.  But I had to keep in mind that she was not really an adult but just out of being a teenager and living on her own for the first time. She really did a great job of accepting where her life has taken her and worked hard to live up to her potential. The only part I didn't like was the love triangle that was starting up but that is just me.  But iIt does add to the story in many ways.

I could see people saying that this book is not suitable for YA but it has nothing that they do not see on TV or the internet every day.  There is a good bit of violence and sex intermingled but that is necessary for the story.  It is really for the mature YA or ones closer to 20 than 13.

The story moved very quickly and kept you on your toes waiting and wondering about what might happen next.  As a reader, you were not exposed to everything at once, but like the characters, you found out things little by little.  That, in my opinion, makes for a good story.

Football has become the sport to unite multiple alien races throughout the galaxy and the planets on which they live. Football has changed.  It is more violent and physical. Some players are even killed during a game. Mankind has evolved and many humans that play are 7 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds and have speed and athletic skills that we can hardly imagine. Top that off with aliens giants that are fast and agile and can catch passes 20 feet in the air and you are beginning to understand the game. Some players weigh over 600 pounds and can bench press over 1300 pounds.  The goal is to win and to survive!

Football was made a galactic sport to help the aliens and humans to learn to play as a team and learn to appreciate each other as teammates and friends. They are to be the examples for all the people in the known universe.  The alternative is hatred of all alien things and war..

Scott Sigler has written a unique Sci-Fi story that it entertaining and uses a sport as a means to bring alien species together.  You can see and understand the conflicts and the beliefs of the different races and how they learn to succeed as a team and through synergy achieve more as a coordinated team that they ever could as individuals.

The storyline of this book is well conceived and entertaining to read. If you love Sci-Fi and football then this is a WIN-Win story for you. I liked the book a lot and I rated it at 5 stars!

I have to agree with another reviewer that some of the personality changes didn't seem real. Ex. The mother in law suddenly liking the heroine, the story didn't clearly show why she made such a quick change, it just didn't make sense.
The plot was cute though and I liked that any misunderstandings were realistic and not over done and dragged on. The heroine didn't misconstrue and assume the worst once married.

I don't require total accuracy if the story is good (though I really love it when it happens!) but when there are statements like ""kick him to the curb"" and a remark about a ""date"" then I get a teensy bit agitated.  To my knowledge, people didn't date in the regency era.  And, one thing that really bothered me was the hero's constant use of ""kitten"" for his wife's name.  Ugh.  Instead of being cute, it was annoying.  When I was in high school a boyfriend kept calling me ""Princess"" even though I asked him not to.  It made me think of my uncle's beagle.

The story is fairly well written, though it has lots of references to the other stories in this series.  The references are fairly easy to follow, but make for a confusing start to the book.  The story itself is fair, but a little rushed-most of the book centers on the time before the characters are married, but most of the action happens after-it makes the end seem really rushed and doesn't allow for very good character conpletion of the H's brother or mother.  The sisters and the h in this book also do NOT in any way conform to the behavior of the time period-the way it seems that they have all entrapped their husbands by manipulation or idiotic behavior (as in this book).  The author seems to try and paint the picture that the girls are somehow victims, but their actions are totally inappropriate for the time period and would have damned their standing in society if they had actually behaved as they are portrayed.  I was also shocked by the several sensual scenes in the book and by the long, drawn out sex scene.  It was almost like the author was trying to give a biology/anatomy lesson in the middle of the book-not enjoyable.  I hadn't seen anything to suggest the level of sexual content in the reviews for this book and now realize that I should have looked at some of the reviews for the other books in this series, which sound every bit as descriptive.

I will admit, I almost gave up on the book, but the melodrama lured me further and further into the book.

However, significant sections of the plot are driven by a combination of factor a) the heroine has been kept super ignorant  b) her father is a super control freak who sees dirt and shame on everything  c) the hero has a Past  d) all his friends have Pasts  and e) their circle of friends seriously needs new people.

Now add in a serious helping of Big Misunderstanding, and repeat any time you feel like the book might be winding down.

If Big Mis plots irritate you, you may want to give this one a past.  It's melodramatic, which I found entertaining after a while.

The whole thing where the hero is led to believe that his bride is not a virgin and possibly pregnant when he marries her, so he stays away from her so she can't pass the kid off as his, so he doesn't find out that she has never been with a man before until WAY TOO LATE in this book kind of wore on me.  The heroine is seriously ignorant of the facts of life, and everyone assumes that someone else means something else when they say things.

147,2,A11QYGVZ3CKNDT,B004JN05KY,"I thought I would give this book of Staci Stallings a try after reading one other book of hers. I thought that, since it was labeled Faith Series, it would be better than the first book I read. Wrong: it was worse.

First, this should not be labeled an adult book. For crying out loud: the setting is college, and it's about two kids in particular, as well as another, who are insecure, and it includes connotations of sleeping around and drinking alcoholic beverages and partying. I am nearing 60, so tell me if I think this setting fits adult contemporary fiction!

Secondly and most importantly, Ms. Stalling's theology is all mixed up. No, it's just wrong. There's no clear witnessing to others about making a profession of faith in Jesus Christ although it is sort-of - and that is weak, at best - implied, and Stallings places more of an emphasis of praying to the Holy Spirit and thanking him rather than making a commitment of one's life to Jesus Christ and praying to HIM! She furthermore, in my opinion, nearly makes the trinity of the Godhead sound more mystical than worshiping the Lord. I would NOT want a child of mine reading this so-called Christian fiction as it is misleading, completely. Yes, the trinity is God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, but one has to be saved as a Christian, i.e. putting one's faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and it is then and only then that one receives the Holy Spirit. When I thank the Lord for helping me, I do not thank the Holy Spirit. I do not tell others of the Holy Spirit before I tell them of the saving grace of Jesus Christ. This could have been an okay story had Ms. Stallings left the so-called Christian aspect out of it - that is the only reason I gave it two stars. Teaching wrong theology will eventually get one into trouble as it is false teaching.",Mixed up Theology or No Theology?,20,2016-05-23

In the Bible, it says we will be reunited with our loved ones, and that we will know them, but it never tells us how we will know them, but we do know that our spirit leaves our body when we die.

Now, having had a JC class on French, and, after reading thousands of books which contained dialogue and quotes in that language, I found those same portions, not just informative, but enjoyable ! I would recommend War n' Peace to Anyone who enjoys Reading and Learning. As someone who fancies himself a middling good Writer, I am always humbled when I read the truly Great Authors, and this re-read was no exception. As I told my Sister Carol, "" I stand amazed that Tolstoy's characters and events which occured over 200 years ago, can grab, and hold ,a modern reader such as myself "", but, I guess that's why both this book, and Tolstoy, are considered ""Classics"". Now, I'm debating whether to go read Anna Karenina, or re-read some Classic Mark Twain ?",""" Liked"" at age 15, ""Treasured"" at age 68.",2,2016-06-27
159,4,A11AZG938XL5UU,B004KZPK6K,"Approaching War and Peace feels like a monumental task. Sitting down and reading it is not for the faint of heart. The story is engrossing and will consume you. It took me about four weeks to finish it because it's not the kind of book that one can read straight through. One puts it down to think about it, coming back after one has digested what has one read.

Set against the backdrop of Napoleonic Europe, the story follows three main Russian families as they navigate the early years of the nineteenth century. Plot? Is there one? Perhaps. Perhaps not. The background history of the Napoleon Wars are what set in motion a lot of the action, especially for the male protagonists who fight in the wars. For the females it seems that love and falling in love and out of love and the passage to adulthood are what drives their stories. Our main protagonist is Pierre Bezukhov, a mirror for Tolstoy himself. The ideas Bezukhov spouts are usually the ideas Tolstoy believes in and wants you to believe in too. Pierre is the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat.

The other families are the Bolkonskys and the Rostovs. The Bolkonskys are right and proper with an autocratic father from one of the lower levels of Hell. The Rostovs are more homely and not so rich but full of love. There are also a couple of other families that play parts such as the Kuragins, who play the part of the somewhat ""evil"" characters. The cast of characters is indeed large as many say. But honestly the main characters that the book follows number about 5 to 10. So it's manageable. Aside from Pierre Bezukhov, there is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, Princess Marya Bolkonskaya, Countess Natalya Rostova, Count Nicholas Rostov, and Helene Kuragina. The rest of the characters are secondary and even Helene is not that important.

The book itself is hard to describe. Is it a novel? Tolstoy didn't think so. Is it history? Though there are huge stretches on the philosophy of history, this is not a history book. Nor is it philosophy. At leas not necessarily good philosophy.  It is something unique. Perhaps that is why War and Peace has attained the status of classic. It is a book that attempts to give one a complete (at least complete aristocratic) view of Russian society between the years 1805 and 1812. Perhaps the German word, 'Gesamtkunstwerk' - total work of art - should be applied to literature.

I read the eBook Pevear-Volokhonsky transalation that goes for $12.99. It was a good translation that captured the spirit of the times. The notes and translations of the French were all hyperlinked which made things easy enough to read and follow. Though I would rather have seen the notes on the bottom of each page rather than the end of each book. Having finished War and Peace, I am glad that I read it. Though I am still not quite certain if it should be regarded as such as a classic. Is it truly that great? I'm still not sure.",Not Quite Fiction. Not Quite History. Not Philosophy.

160,5,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,B004KZPK6K,"War and Peace takes place from 1805 to 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars that ravaged Europe. It primarily follows the lives of several Russian aristocratic families as they live their lives and cope with the world around them. This includes characters that go off to war and grapple with the reality of fighting and the ultimate question of what the purpose of war is. There is Pierre Bezukhov who suddenly becomes incredibly wealthy after inheriting his late father's fortune and spends time trying to seek meaning from life. In addition to this, there is romance stories, philosophical discussions, and plenty of action. Indeed, it can be hard to adequately summarize such a sweeping and long work as this.

Widely recognized as one of the greatest novels ever written, it is also infamous for being one of the longest. For me, going through my life with the usual distractions, it took a few months to make it through the whole thing. But after finishing it, I felt that it was completely worth the effort. Its length may be intimidating to many, but it is very rewarding book to read and ultimately finish.

I have a complaint about the Kindle edition. Although the text of the book is fine, I noticed many spelling problems with the bonus content and footnotes. A minor annoyance.

I was so looking forward to War and Peace as Anna Karenina is one of my favourite books. I was very disappointed with War and Peace as it felt like two very different books. One part is a history lesson in excruciating detail about the war and various theories on human behaviour and its influence on historic events. The other half is fiction about young aristocrats navigating adulthood and all its complications. I think this was done on purpose as Tolstoy wanted the war to be a metaphor for the coming of age of his protagonists but it wasn't executed properly as he focuses on the war more than his principal characters.

This book was written shortly after Tolstoy became deeply religious and all his characters come into their adulthood by some profound religious experience which I found to be unrealistic and preachy. I do admire and respect the scope of the book as it really does capture all aspects of life but it lacked that
indescribable quality that made Anna Karenina feel like a world the reader inhabited alongside the characters.","War, Peace & Life Itself",4,2016-04-21

I could see the truth in a lot of his motivations, thoughts, and actions from a male perspective. Nicely done.
The supporting characters are well done, for the most part. Alexs best friend is just what a powerful corporate raider needs. Natalies family is dysfunctional at best, except for her father who loves her, but holds a secret that may just tear the entire family apart. Her godmother is very proud of Natalie but holds secrets of her own that end up causing problems in Natalies life.
Alex never suspects that his plans to ruin a family name and business would end up with his own agony and need for something he never knew he wanted. Something he never knew he needed before.
The writing was strong, as was the plot and main characters. A couple of the supporting cast were a little weak, but I saw why things were done from a writers view point.

She is a sex therapist....and not just any therapist either, she is a world widely known therapist.  She does tv spots, lectures, you name it, she's probably done it.

What she doesn't expect is to be at a party and see a man across the room that makes her heart pound and her panties wet.  That man was none other than Ben.  When he looked up and saw her, he was done for, he crossed the room, grabbed her for a dance then led her outside.  Sparks flew between these two.  But when he found out the woman he had in his arms was none other than the Notorious Dr. Logan, he felt a rush of panic and high tailed it outta there.

This story tells us the story of how Regina and Ben managed to finally get their HEA.  It is one roller coaster ride after another.  Great story line, great characters, awesome descriptions to details and fantastic dialogue between characters.

All in all, a fantastic book.

Would I recommend this book? Yes

Would I read more from this author?  Yes

183,2,AQ619VL5LFGEO,B004RUXQGE,"""Belief is a powerful magic.

Valerie Diaz has a power that she can't contain, and it's killing her. Bounced between foster homes and the streets, she only has time to concentrate on staying alive. But a visit from the imaginary friend of her childhood opens a world of possibilities, including a new life half a universe away on a planet that is bursting with magic.

The Society of Imaginary Friends follows Valerie on a journey that straddles two worlds. In order to survive, she must travel many light years away to a realm where anything is possible. On the Globe, imaginary friends come to life, the last of the unicorns rules the realm, and magic seeps from the pores of all the Conjurors who live there. But choosing to embrace her potential will set Valerie on a treacherous course  one filled with true love, adventure and perilous danger.""- Amazon description

Doesn't this sound like fun? Unfortunately what it sounds like and what it is are two very different things. I almost DNF'd it at 35% because it was boring, annoying, and not well thought out. One of the most annoying things in the first third of the book was the treatment of Valerie's magic. Valerie finds out her imaginary friends that she's had from childhood are really real and projecting from a planet, called the Globe, hidden in a black hole. They inform her she had strong magical abilities and if she stays on earth she will die because somehow living here stifles magic (for the most part).  But before she leaves she has to go to England and undergo a test of her abilities. Whut?

First she is told she has too much magic to survive on earth then she has to travel from the US to England to take a test to prove she has all this magic she was just told she has? Then she has to go to Egypt to find the last transport from earth to the Globe. Not only didn't this make a whole lot of sense, it was boring.

Valerie is that most over used type of heroine- the Mary Sue, or in Val's case more like a Super Sue. Because Val not only is stuffed with all this magic and has these not so imaginary friends and enemies but she is Alone In The World.  Yes, my friends, Val is alone, so alone. She is alone, aloner, alonest. No one, no where, no how, is more alone. On two different planets Val wins all three Olympic medals for being alone.

Except when she isn't. No, really, it seems she keeps stumbling over another character that is alone for various reasons. This author desperately needs an editor or two because all this aloneness repeated endlessly just makes you want to throw something. Like Valerie. Out into space where she will be alone, so alone, no one will ever be... sorry, it's hard to shake.

Like I said I almost gave up but I pushed on and it got marginally better. Val arrives at the Globe and meets her imaginary childhood friend, makes more friends, acquires a magical sword in the best sword-in-the-stone manner, and keeps putting herself in dangerous situations because asking for advice and/or help would be the smart thing to do and a Mary Super Sue like Val needs to be smarter than most everyone else but still dumb enough to get tied to the railroad tracks or the magical equivalent.

So Val and her friends stumble around the Globe doing their level best to put themselves in harm's way and succeeding with tiresome frequency. She just can't bring herself to wait for other more experienced characters to explore and investigate but that doesn't matter because Val is a Super Sue and will prevail over all and manifest new powers or magics or whatever because that's what Sues do.

In the end she triumphs over her not-so-imaginary enemy and does something that hasn't been done in decades and good triumphs over evil and her magical power is awesome and rare and now she is the superset of Mary Super Sues. Except that evil isn't destroyed just dented a little because this is a 4 book series.

184,3,A2G45Q8V20R779,B004RUXQGE,"This is a good choice for a younger reader who loves Fantasy.  The world of magic (Globe),  which was secluded from Earth, has a lot of potential.  The writing was good, and the descriptive scenes were well done.

It took me a while to warm up to the characters at first.  I found it hard to connect with them.  But eventually their personalities won me over.  I remember thinking that the Unicorn was a bit over the top, but ended up respecting her place in the story.  Although there's much more to the story, I'm glad that it didn't end in the middle of an action scene with a cliffhanger.

My only issue was the flow of the plot.  It seemed a bit choppy and wasn't as smooth as it should have been.  Because of this, it didn't keep my interest properly.

This is a rambling series of vignettes that seem to all take place in about a years span of Tom's childhood.  He lives with his brother Syd, Cousin Amy and their Aunt Polly in a village along the Mississippi in the hey days of the riverboats and water transportation and the Pre Civil War era.  Tom is intrepid and mischievous and he's a fun scamp to go along with.  Many of his adventures are light and easily dealt with like talking a bunch of boys into getting him through his chore punishment, first crush, pretend games and late night outings, but there is a dangerous adventure that brings Tom and Huck to witness a murder and encounter some dangerous thieves.

I think I appreciated this more as an adult than I did as a kid.  It's rather nostalgic and I can see why Twain would call it his Ode to Boyhood.

It's actually a decent story but it was simply way too short and felt more like I was reading a few chapters plucked out of a novel. Both Roan, Addy, and her brother Jack were likable characters and the plot had huge potential, however, there just wasn't enough time for development. I have always enjoyed Ms. Templeton's writing though, and this was no exception.

On Thursday, October 12, 2017, I discovered that all of her Gothics were on sale for Kindle and in a rash moment, purchased them all.

I devoured This Rough Magic and to my delight, I still love as much as I did the first time and maybe a bit more as I now have life experience and can appreciate certain nuances now that I didn't back in the day. Much of the reason I love it is not only due to a complex plot and well-developed characters, but because even her minor characters have a few details that make them memorable.

This Rough Magic is one of my three favorites of hers, well-written, intriguing plot, satisfying ending, and characters that keep you guessing. It had been over 50 years since I read it the first time, but the details remained with me over the years. That's the mark of an accomplished author. So many books today are forgettable by the day after we read them; it's nice to be reminded of a time when the world was slower and people interacted with people instead of electronic devices.

If you haven't read a book by Mary Stewart, I believe you are missing a treat, especially if you like intelligent writing with just the right amount of description to bring the setting to life. Her books are reflective of the time in which they were written, so don't be surprised by the attitudes of the characters. Are our attitudes better today? Yes and no.

The story was in depth and without a doubt very well thought out. I have read the entire series before posting a review so I could review the entire series instead of just one book. I will copy and paste to the other versions as well. As stated Demon Souled was well written and proofread. HOWEVER, this is the only one I can say that about. Overall I read it all and was able to delve into the story, however the poor proofreading and grammar in some situations caused an interruption in the story. As I was reading I would stop confused and then realize he mistyped something or used the wrong word as a typo. Something proofreading his work would have corrected. His repetition often caused me to skip chapters at a time for details I got tired of reading again and again, just to get back to the story. It felt like filler material. I still give him four stars simply because if you get around those negative aspects of the books. The story is unique and compelling.

Bernard is a young man, heir to a great holding, and under persistent pressure from his father to marry. However, when Bernard finally discovers the woman he wants, he finds that not only is she already married, but she is wed to an abusive monster. Joanna has been living in hell for the past year since being wed to Ralf. She has spirit, but sadly, most of that has been beaten out of her as she fears for her life. Upon meeting Bernard, she feels a spark of life and a desperate hope for a different future.

This was only 70 pages so you can predict where the story was going and what would happen to the villainous Ralf. Despite this predictability, I still enjoyed the story and thought that Gleason did a nice job introducing new characters for her other books in the series, while also crafting a nice romance that felt complete in the short page length.

202,4,A3I704B6J3MOT,B004X2JH5U,"The Lost Files are short stories that fill in details between the major Lorien Legacy books. Whilst it's not necessary to read them as such, they are well worth the read as they are full of great information for the main story, as well as really enjoyable in their own right. Each of the shorts tells another piece of the puzzle in relation to one of the Garde, or another minor character, giving you back ground information.
This particular short is about Six, and her past. Six was introduced in I am Number Four, coming to the aid of Four as he fought the Mogs at the end of the story, but we know little about her history, other than she has been alone for a while, and that her Cepan is dead.
This story fills in those details, covering the time frame from the landing, up until she heads off to find Number Four.
Again, this is a great fun read, nothing overly stressing, just an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon and get into an entertaining story.
For me, I actually found the writing in this one to be a bit better quality than I am Number Four, so I am not sure if each of the books is being written by the same person under the alias Pittacus Lore or by using that as the pen name, it has allowed them to get multiple authors to do the shorts as well as the main stories (Havent really bothered checking into it if anyone has, or does know?) Either way, the story line in this one was very good, and I found it interesting following how Six was Sorry No Spoilers!!
Needless to say, Sixs journey was a lot different to Fours and she had a difficult time.
It's worth the read to understand how she is different  thats what is good about these short stories.
If you are a fan of the series, this is a must read.
As I have said with the other books , this is no Shakespeare, so don't expect it, but do expect good fun, a bit of escapism and the great bit of Heros fighting off an evil alien race  just as this type of book should be.

203,2,A26F5B12T242LL,B004X6R8Y8,"genre: scifi/fantasy, some romance
setting: distant future, spaceships
format: standalone
mood: tearjerker
triggers: cliffhanger, sexual assault (off camera / before book starts)

This book has an odd disconnect that occurs around the 60% mark. Before that, the story is mostly a scifi/fantasy about a woman who escapes slavery and builds herself a new life among nice people. This part of the story is nicely done but a tearjerker. There is some romance, but the focus is on her building a new life. This part was 4-star for me.

Everything changes around the 60% mark. Instead of building to a climax and finishing this book's plot, the rest of the pages are devoted to a weird and incomplete new ""save the world"" thing. We only get the set-up, though, and it ends in a cliffhanger. The plotting and characterizations go from solid to kinda shoddy, with inexplicable acts of random stupidity (TSTL), characters behaving in ways that just did not make sense to me, logical inconsistencies, and characters we were supposed to like who act fairly despicably. Basically, everything to do with the ship's special cargo delivery is not worth reading. This means you loose out on a climax to the well written ""finding yourself"" plot; and the romance plot's climax is pretty pathetic. My specific complaints would be spoilers, so I will omit all but one (see below). This part of the book was 1-star for me.

Her paranormal abilities are...kind of a bust, in that they mostly only impact the plot during the end of the book, after the writing quality declines.

[*** Spoiler ***]

So, here is the worst of the internal inconsistency problems. Theoretically her dad is some sort of a great psychic with powers to foretell the future. Those are so spot-on perfect that he can commit a subject to a 350 year plan culminating in hiring a specific ship to carry a specific cargo at a specific time...but he cannot predict whether that ship's captain is good or evil; and he cannot accurately choose a ship to carry his wife and daughters to safety?

Let me just say I really wanted to like this story and am indeed curious as to where the character's story will lead in the other books, but I'm not willing to sit through the poorly executed writing style and lack of storytelling imagination to do it.
I found that 90% of the book was redundantly and relentlessly panning between the two characters while they tried to figure out if the other liked them or not, all while taking part in completely innocuous activities. This of course is established through assumptions and poor to little communication at a painstaking pace. The author mentions a few important events that are briefly touched upon in the book and quickly skips over as if in a hurry to get back to a character washing dishes or some innane thing, spending far too much time on surface character building with little insight. The whole thing read like:  'Oh, I was enslaved and torchured...but, moving on', 'by the way, we were attacked in space...but did you have a nice time making idle chit chat today?' I was about to pull my hair out from boredom and frustration until the very end when suddenly a slew of hurriedly- structured and choppy events came crashing down, one after the next. I was soooo starved for anything by that point that I ate it up with rapt attention. Even still, the author didn't really expand upon any of it, and was severely lacking. Anything of importance felt like a quick summation, even their bonding- which pissed me off as 99% of the book is dedicated to the extremely s...l...o...w build of their relationship which is so forgettable I can't even remember the character's names off cuff.

I have raised chickens from chicks for many years and while they are the best experience that I have ever had, learning before you dive into chicken raising is a must.

I have had the leghorns, silkies, Rhode island reds, and Americana. Out of the ones that I have had I love the Americana, and the reds. The reds are great birds for our climate. They are hardier to the colds. The book goes into details on the best egg birds and the meat birds. I do not kill them for food, just eggs. I grow to love them too much.

I should have read the synopsis and disclaimer more closely, so I can't blame the author for my error in judgment.
Anyway...I still didn't like the book:
* Profuse use of the c and p words. (Trashy - not sexy at all)
* Too many irritating editing issues, ie spelling, skipped/dropped words, clumsy sentences, etc.
* Semi-boring sex scenes.
* Weird plot issues...like when everyone is fearing for their lives in Ethan's kitchen, with danger approaching at any minute, the heroine's mind is consumed with wanting to jump Ethan's bones. I get it - he's a hot incubus. Still - I think the first thing in any woman's mind would be ""Who or what is trying to kill us? And - Let's get the hell outta' here!""
* A TSTL heroine...especially in the scene where she yells to a vampire ""Stop, or I'll shoot!"" Really? It's a vampire trying to kill your incubus/boyfriend, and he's coming after you next. To hell with a warning - roll up and bust a few caps!

231,2,AT0ZT3V40YVN5,B00507TKCW,"LONG review with spoilers.

This started out so promising, a 3 possibly a 4 star book with great writing, a dark and mysterious alpha hero in search of revenge and an intelligent heroine with her own, much milder past. At the 37% mark, thank you Kindle for accuracy, I had my first doubts then, later, smart characters doing stupid things ruined it.

Mikhael, the H has come to England to exact revenge on Charles, smug, self-satisfied, VERY ambitious fiancee of Sara, the beloved cousin to Hs BF. Charles is also a very evil doer. VERY as in not a fun bad guy, but a gross bad guy that needs to die a horrible death. [He not only owns various kinds of brothels (your run of the mill whorehouse, BDSM brothel where one can be beaten or beat, and, oh joy, a brothel that specialize in young children and virgins). Charles likes to frequent them as an avid customer as well especially after seeing his upper crust, self-contained fiancee. Charles the villain wants an earldom and wants Sara, daughter of a Duke, to help him get the status update. Sara was mildly crippled in her first season, lost out on love, and wants to get married, Shes a smart cookie, likes Charles enough, adores his daughter, and figures what the heck, so to speak.

In the quest for revenge, and to save Sara from marrying a sanctimonious whoremonger, the H seduces Sara at her own engagement ball. The shark started jumping at this point. From here on end, ranting spoiler

Under the ploy of telling Sara what a rotter her fiancee is, she and the H end up in the library during the ball. He doesnt just kiss her, but he seduces her to the point she is partially disrobed when her father, cousin, and fiancee come in. I did not buy it. Yes, the h was attracted to the H, but she is an intelligent and honorable woman. No way did I buy the nipple exposure. It was a cheap shot at implying overwhelming passion. Just as well he did it though, as Charles the evil fiancee not only calIs her a slut, but a cripple in need of a husband in front of her father and cousin. Excuse me, what a fine time for a duel.

The H and h end up marrying, and things are looking up. Then the revenge plot goes into full swing. The H is tightening the noose on the evil Charles. As if the brothels weren't enough, Charles has had people killed and arson set for a railroad deal. He needs to die basically. The H has such a specific revenge plot in place its ridiculous. The H wants honor in all ways

The H rescues Jenny, one of the girls from the virgin/pedophile brothel, while leaving the rest of the girls and children there. Jenny is one of the few characters whose brain cells function from beginning to end of this story. Shes a feisty and sweet girl who just wants a chance at life as well as a chance to spit on the evil guys grave. She ends up with her own little romance which she really deserved.

Angst, angst, and more angst. When I finally gave up the ghost is when the h finds out that Charles daughter was kidnapped in Jennys stead and was taken to the virgin/pedophile brothel. Jenny tells the h not to go, but the h has to rescue the little girl. Jenny says take lots of backup. Does the h take a battalion of the guards the H has left behind? No. The h runs off with the Hs turbaned sidekick to one of the most evil characters in the book. Spare me from good, smart characters turned criminally stupid. Really. One guy. One guy against the manager of a brothel that buys and sells young girls and children that are there against their will. The very brother that is OWNED by her spurned and vengeful ex-fiancee? If the h had been an impetuous character I might have bought it, but shes intelligent AND she has been warned and told what a total creep her ex-fiancee is. Right into the lions den she goes. To make matters worse, the evil ex-fiancee who monologues about the evils of women as he debauches virgins, pops into the room to check out the latest virgin only to find out its his kidnapped daughter. Hes horrified..

Such a promising start. Great writing, interesting characters, intricate plot, but the two main characters degenerated into such stupidity I couldn't get beyond it. The H I could handle as his reasons for wanting revenge are clear and understandable. ..[Charles the evil fiancee met him when he was ten and a slave in Tripoli (I think). Charles bought the H who thought he would be freed. Charles proceeded to sodomize him, beat him, then gave him away to be turned into a eunuch.

Oh yeah, and the evil fiancee mildly blackmails the Duke, the h's father, because her dad went to the BDSM brothel for a little paddling as he felt lost after his wife died. I guess that's the eighth stage of grief: spank me. The dad doesn't feel bad about encouraginghis only daughter to accept the creep's hand because he's still a gentleman.",Promising start.

Peregrine, a wanderer and a man of mystery, comes to London for revenge on a man who destroyed his life. Stylizing himself as a Prince, Peregrine enlists the help of an old friend, Ross Carlisle, to introduce him in society.

Lady Sara St. James, Ross's cousin, meets Peregrine and is immediately intrigued by him. Sara is sheltered and cosseted. She's done everything correct - as a proper lady should, yet Peregrine's wildness begins to rub off on her.

The only problems: Sara's betrothed and her fiance is who Peregrine has come to destroy.

A bodice-ripping historical romance, this was an interesting read. Some of it was overly dramatic and at times, it felt like a morality lesson. There's a continuity issue in the book, but not a major one. Just enough to make me recheck to make sure.

There is also some wonderful information here about parts of the world that I didn't know about and now have been researching for more.

My conclusion is based on the disturbed leading man, Peregrine.  His love affair with Lady Sara St. James is spun out nicely with a lot of tantalizing ebb and flow, and the sex scenes are not forcibly graphic but rather full of allusion and figurative prose.  The author's command of Middle and Far Eastern history, geography, and culture was impressive.  Peregrine's traumatic past has, however, made him rather warped, and although the story is largely about his redemption from his own demons, I found it to be less than relaxing.

The characterization of the hero is more detailed and believable. Whether you agree with his method of revenge, he has justification. The author is trying to use the heroine's moral compass to rescue the hero, but in the process, I lost empathy for the heroine.

The hero (Ned) was not very likable. I had a hard time believing he survived being a war spy when his behavior was so foolish.

Heroine (Jane) was a little better because she was so selfless and self-sufficient, but she also made so really idiotic choices. However, at least by the end, she could readily admit her errors in judgment. The back characters were well developed, and I actually liked them better, especially Violet.

The writing was very good, as was the editing. Thankfully this book was not all about the sex, even though a few of the scenes were explicit.

And once Charlie arrived, she found her neighbor Jason to be such a temptation. Jason's last GF decided she doesn't want to be a farm girl, so he's suspicious of any city girls, including Charlie. Then Charlie found a ghost in her aunt's dance hall... His name is Harm, and he died in 1936, after promising to elope. And his love's name was Charlotte... Charlie's great-great-great-grand-aunt. Charlotte died of a broken heart and never married, and somehow, both Charlotte and Harm are stuck on this mortal plane, unable to pass. Charlie promised Harm to help any way she can... and she'll need Jason's help to do it...

If you don't have a problem with the possibly of life on the other side, even teens would enjoy this story.  I LOVED it.  The heroine travels to a remote farm to be with an aunt that she barely knows.  Her mother thought she needed help after breaking bones in her foot.  She arrives to find a cowboy that just sets her off and the aunt is fine on her own but delighted to see her niece.  She finds a whole different kind of life from the one she had in the city.

She has a special gift.  She can feel energy and hear voices of those that have passed on.  She can also see spirits.  No one quite understands the gift and thinks she has a problem.  She has received such negative feedback when she has discussed her gift that she doesn't talk about it very often.  she arrives to her aunt's house, one that has been in the family for generations and immediately starts to pick up on a spirit in the house.  She is not afraid but feels the spirit wants something from her.  Seeing a picture of a long ago relative she recognizes herself as well as being named after this person.

255,2,A17RW6P0XAHW1H,B0051V5QNY,"Well...I liked it and I did not like it.
 First off at a mere 90ish pages I would not call it a novel.
 It also ends very abruptly with a link to purchase book 2 which seems more likely that it is the second half of what should have been the rest of this book.

 Annie and Neal ""had to"" get married. Actually when Annie got pregnant Neal would have rather she had an abortion. He never wanted ""Baby Natasha"" and is not all that fond of being a husband either at only 21 years old.

 Neal works a minimum wage job and resents that he had to leave school to support a baby he never wanted.
 I read a lot of horror and I never really expect it to make sense so I have no problem at all with this story line of a 5 month old baby being out to kill. What did bother me was a couple of things that the author seemed to presume, such as one character mentioning that a 5 month old baby can't even sit up yet. Sure they may topple over but babies can indeed sit up usually any time between 4-7 months.  While it may be unusual for a 5 month old to want to kill anyone I don't see why the author would find it unusual for a 5 month old to sit up. He also seems to presume that breast size has anything to do with milk production. Hence Annie's thoughts that she needed to supplement with formula because of not having large breasts. Most of all what really grated on my nerves was that a character (Annie) who is so paranoid of crib death and who is always reading books on baby care would ever in a million years leave her baby in a car alone in a parking lot. No I take that back, what bothered me the most was Annie's baby talk. It made me want to throat punch her.

 Other than that, it was not a bad story. I mean who doesn't love a good evil baby story? But somehow even though this is currently free at amazon I feel cheated, because I thought this was a complete ""novel"" and not just half.",I feel cheated,2,2016-05-20

""We've Gone Too Far."" - ""The Expanse"" tag line

 Five EXPANSIVE Stars. Based on the novels of the talented two-man SciFi writing team called ""James S.A. Corey"" and also based on the Syfy Channel 10-episode production of their novels, this novella is from that universe. Set 200 years in the future, it shows how fractured mankind has become in this reality.

 The storyline of ""The Butcher of Anderson Station"" picks up with Colonel Johnson drinking in a bar served by a reluctant bartender. His feelings about 'Belters', those born in the weak gravity of the asteroid belt in the solar system, are about to take a sharp turn as he comes to grips with his past military encounter at Anderson Station, meets an unusual man, and he gets a fateful surprise at the end, as the storylines jump between two timelines, past and present. Fans of ""The Expanse"" may enjoy this highly-detailed prequel-like short story which explains specifically and graphically what the TV show jumped over about the Anderson Station encounter in Season 1, Episode 5, at 32 minutes in. Those not familiar with ""The Expanse"" may be left hanging, wondering what comes next, and go looking for answers in the other books or on TV. Highly Recommended. Five INFORMATIVE Stars.

This is an interesting read.  However, the science behind the plot is very thin. Assumptions are made that are invalid.  The editing is poor in places!  This is understandable because editing a long book becomes difficult because you see what you are thinking, not what you are reading.  The spelling is also poor.  This is sad because of spell checkers built into modern authoring software.  Also, radio protocol is invalid.  It really gets to me when I read or hear ""over and out.""  What does ""over and out"" mean?  Well, let's break it down.  First understand that radio protocol was developed for half-duplex radio transmissions.  Half-duplex only allows a speaker and a listener.  Both the speaker and listener cannot speak at the same time.  Therefor, bearing this in mind, I hope the following makes more sense!  ""Over"" means ""I am done talking.  I am turning talking ""over"" to listener.""  ""Out"" means the conversation is complete and the transmission is terminated, or ""I am leaving and ""out"" of this transmission!  So, now let's put ""over and out"" together and see what it means.  ""Over"" = you go ahead and talk; ""and out"" = I am hanging up now!  So it means ""you talk now and I am hanging up on you!""  Another thing that bothers me is the failure to understand ""chain of command!""  An Admiral's Second in Command is a Sargent.  Oh really!  A friend of mine's father was a three star general in the Army.  He had five aides to chaffer him, to cook, to keep his house in order, to schedule his time, and to act as his secretary.  Under his command were various generals, colonels, lieutenant colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants, second lieutenants, sergeants, corporals, specialists, etc.  Each of the officers had responsibilities to make sure that all of the requirements of command were met.  Remember, the military is a giant bureaucracy with requirements for warriors and support personnel.  This concept is lost in this novel.

Summary: the novel just carries you on, but slows down with too many story lines.  Editing is poor.  Research seems nonexistent.  Characters are rather two dimensional.

Finally: despite my criticisms I have purchased all books in this series!  Why?  The best reason for reading a linked set of novels: I want to find out what happens!  I hope that I will not be disappointed.

My recommendation, buy the first book in the series and decide if you want to continue!

271,4,A3RK5D0VVDGCPP,B0055PMRSS,"As police procedural authors go, its hard to think of a more reliable or interesting one than Michael Connelly, who has been writing about Harry Bosch for more than twenty years at this point. Connellys novels are fascinating not just as mystery stories, but as snapshots of time  they're uniquely contemporary, reflecting concerns of the time, and letting Bosch and the other characters age in real time, more or less. His short stories, by definition, aren't as complex, and feel a bit less linked to their time and place; that doesnt, however, make them less engaging to read, just somewhat less rich.

Connellys Angle of Investigation, then, is interesting partially just for how its three stories ran the gamut of possibilities for Connellys Bosch stories, in all sorts of ways  focus, approach, scale, and even quality. For instance, one story, Christmas Even, walks us through the mechanics of a murder investigation; the second, Fathers Day, mainly revolves around Boschs skills in the interrogation room; the third, the title story, follows Bosch using his years of experience to unravel a cold case with only one real lead. It all serves as a nice triptych of Boschs skills, and a sort of mosaic that presents his strengths. More than that, each gets into a different aspect of Boschs life: Christmas Even explores his isolation and love of jazz, Fathers Day gets into his relationship with his daughter (a bit), and Angle of Investigation gets into his history on the police force.

Its the quality of each story, though, that tells you the most about them. Christmas Even is far and away the best of the three: it features the most compelling case, the most involved narrative, the best emotional beats for Bosch, and the most satisfying narrative that ties it all together. Fathers Day isn't bad at all, though; the interrogation scene is riveting work, and a testament to Connellys gift for listening as cops work their magic to get a confession that they know is coming  its just that the Bosch emotional beats aren't as strong. As for Angle of Investigation, itsfine, I suppose, as long as you can get past the least interesting story by far and a narrative that feels thrown together and barely holds up. Theres a great hook there, with Bosch being asked to revisit the first dead body he ever found on the force, but the story we get is weak, and far from Connellys usual careful work. Nonetheless, its a collection well worth reading, especially for fans; you have two really great ones, and even Angle of Investigation is intriguing for its window into a young Harry Bosch, fresh on the beat.",A solid collection that shows the range of Connelly's Bosch stories,2,2016-12-20

This book number four in the series just wasn't up to the usual standard I'm accustomed to from a Wentworth novel.  Plus, I was really disappointed because I immediately realized I had not read this one before and was looking forward to settling down with a good read.  Sadly, my hopes were dashed -- and I don't just mean on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.

First off, there wasn't nearly enough Miss Silver written into this plot.  Just goes to show what happens if you leave your main character out of the action for too long.  I know Miss Silver is old fashioned, but she's smart as a whip and that's the reason I read these books in the first place.  A Miss Silver book largely minus Miss Silver is not going to go very far with me.

Second, this heroine is a drip!  And, drat it, she remained a drip throughout the whole book.  The pale, fragile kind of young woman who can't say Boo to a goose and wraiths herself around doing just what she's told even when her own instincts are screaming for her to buck up and get some backbone.  I'm okay with a heroine who starts out being a drip but somehow that needs to change pretty quickly or I end up irritated with her.  This was irritation run amuck.

The first story is about Maddie Cooper. Maddie just came from a Jane Austen tour from England and was so inspired to start her own English tea shop in Austin,Texas. And like Jane Austen's Emma, she thinks she is a natural matchmaker. Only to find out that she isn't.

I have not read Emma by Jane Austen but because of this book I wanted to read it. Jane Austen is like every girl's favorite writer. I liked Pride and Prejudice but I just hadn't gotten to reading the rest of her works. I will try find time to do just that. I will try to sneak it in between reading contemporary writers.

I had fun in this book. A light read and makes you feel good. Aside from the fact that I love tea which what this book is about, it gives off a really relaxing vibe. Just like drinking a hot cup of tea. It settles your nerves and it would make you feel like all is well in the world. The book is also funny. I like how Maddie is so clueless as to how other people feel about her because she's too focused on her matchmaking.

Unfortunately, the only man who has caught her eye (and supposedly her affections since she was but a mere girl of fifteen and she fell in love with him while he was defending his brother's honor and paying off her family to keep his brother from being ""trapped into marriage"" by her ""whore of a sister""). Not exactly the type of man I would go for, but whatever. When she notices that the man in question has disappears, not only follows him, but upon meeting him allows him to take her to a darker part of the garden and kiss her senseless. Now perhaps it could be argued that a girl as naive as a brand new debutante should be may allow this, (although I would then argue that she would have been raised better). but Elizabeth does not react the way a blushing virgin would. No, she is an eager and seemingly experienced participant - only regretting the turn of events when she is caught by the ton's biggest gossips.

Derek on the other hand knows exactly who Elizabeth is, but that doesn't stop him from toying with her. He takes her on outings where they spend time together (unchaperoned I might add), and he even takes her to an empty house that he has recently purchased and ends up bedding her. While he originally argued that was not his intent, it certainly didn't stop him from demanding that she undress and then giving into his baser desires. If he truly did not meant to bed her, than he should never have taken her to the home alone.

Somewhere in the middle of this fiasco, they end up falling in love (because they kind of have in order for this to be a romance), and even though he's treated her horribly, she forgives them and they live happily ever after seemingly with no repercussions whatsoever from their sordid and scandalous beginning.

All in all, I am sure there are some people who will enjoy this novella for exactly the reasons I didn't care for it. And as long as its free, you really don't have anything to lose. Not even a large amount of your time as the book can be read in one sitting (probably within an hour or two).","Quick read, but not one of my favorites",4,2016-01-23

I highly recommend it. The hero was yummy and so protective. The heroine was poorly mistreated by her father. I was happy to see the hero come in with his pack to save the heroine.

291,4,A1BRH1Y2RVCIJ6,B005A8SPU4,"I struggled with writing this review, because this book left me more torn about this series than the first one. I think it hit what I expected in a good way, but also hit what I also expected in a bad way as well.

The series picks up with the best parts of the plot from The Change: the Bachelor Battles, the rebels fighting the Network, and the dynamic Pruett family and their arch-nemesis, Rankin. In fact, I think the Pruetts do the best here, growing from just killers with occasional feelings to full characters. Angelica excels as a main character and her chosen mate after the Bachelor Battles allows her an opportunity to excel at something other than violence.

The problem? Two parts: 1. The editing is awful. She needs a new editor, pronto. The writing can be absolutely atrocious in parts - she's very lucky her story propels people along so well. The change in POV is actually welcome to me as it gives missing pieces of the action, but the writing itself needs strengthening, especially double checking typos and tenses within sentences. 2. There's an obsession about showing sex scenes between the females and their (sometimes willing) male partners. The sex scenes aren't written well (I'd say, level of 50 Shades quality) and often I think the story could have been stronger had she just had the character close the door to the room and perhaps have an observer note sounds outside.

The reason I gave this four stars? Its because of the story of the rebellion, the Bachelor Battles, and the Network, and the meetings with the different untamed populations of the world. She has a touch there that makes it really interesting to interact in the world of these characters, and the Pruett family dynamic makes them extremely interesting and often surprising characters to read.

I am very interested in finding out what happens in the final book in the trilogy, but I might also suggest some kind of free prequel about the history of the change and how it came to infect all people and species. The reactions of the other species in this book make me think it has the potential to be reversible in many species or controllable within this world, but we don't have enough information about the backstory to figure out more about it, and in her discussions of the change in the book we get the bare minimum about how it actually affects the females - nothing about how it works or comes to be.","Uneven in quality, but the story makes up for it in motivating you to keep reading.",5,2016-01-28
292,3,AAKO4YAM9BZE5,B005BXVG36,"This short story was originally published in ""The Mammoth Book of Regency Romance"" and will take most people no more than 20-30 minutes at most to finish. Except for one kissing scene with a little clothed touching, it was otherwise clean with no sex. It's about a young lady (Annalise) who is kidnapped on the way to her wedding by her own betrothed (Griffin) who's masquerading as a highwayman... Although a quick and easy read, it was just too short for any real growth or character development. I liked both Annalise and Griffin well enough and thought their romance was sweet, but neither made a big impression on me. Personally, I'm not sure I'd even pay $0.99 for it since its over with before you know it.

293,2,A3AM6MXENFRF3G,B005CM1S02,"This is my first time reading this author and was hoping for a lot more than this. Some of the reviews talked about how funny it was and while I found some of it pretty funny, for the most part I did not. Spoilers: First off the children in this are 7yrs old, not three. They have no discipline no parental direction and no respect for others. This is the result of a weekend disney land dad taking full time custody of them. When you're a weekend parent its all about the fun and the treats but when you have to take care of them as in this scenario its a whole new ball game. The 3 yr old in several scenes speaks more like a grown up than a 3 yr old should. On to the characters...I didn't like Murphy one little bit. There was nothing endearing about him at all. He was arrogant to the point of being ridiculous and he was a terrible parent. He is one of those parents who thinks their obnoxious brats are cute,They're not. Gail doesn't like kids but its never really explained why. Because she was raped by a cop? That doesn't have correlation to me and that was about as close to a reason as they gave. Other than that, she came across as a typical harried public servant with too many cases and not enough help. I didn't find her to be over the top with idealism but she believed to an extent in her clients, some may actually be innocent. Now on the the legal aspects of this. There are so many situations that are presented here that would warrant at the very least discipline by the bar if not dis-barrable offenses it is just mind boggling. Murphy offers a wager in where they will bet her clients possible settlement? Hmmm no no no, bad lawyer. She gets an offer of 10 grand and doesn't take it to her client? Nope again. Law requires that all offers of settlement be presented to the client. Here's another one...She thinks, well he's already breached confidentiality with his lawyer...again no. Lawyers have privileged communication that is a higher standard than confidence. Confidential information can be subpoenaed, like your tax returns or bank records, privileged cannot (unless there is death or other circumstances, threats etc). Then there is the fact that she is a Public Depender. That means her salary is funded by Public Money...She cannot take on a civil suit and the PD's office cannot take a third of the settlement on contingency. Yes towards the end of the book her secretary said something about not letting her boss know she took a case on the side, but if it was on the 'side' then why the 30% contingency? As for the fees incurred by the news paper the fact that the bill was faxed from the opposing client to her office with a communication to her about paying, that is just wrong on all sides of it. Fees are determined by the court. Opposing clients cannot contact opposing counsel. That's what their lawyer is for. For Murphy to blame her for her clients illegal activities was just silly and just emphasized his arrogance. I was really hoping to like this bc it seemed it would be different but all of the glaring mistakes into the Law and the Lawyers just grated on my nerves. I almost stopped reading it when he tried to wager the outcome of the settlement.

BUT, the protagonist of the story is just a B=tch who considers herself a witch and that leads to the part of the book that just ruined the whole thing for me .  The author makes it clear that wicca, witchcraft, druidry, and any other variation of similar paganism is dark, evil, and is only to turn people away from the true light of God.  The Heroine has dabbled and run away back to God.  Unfortunately, there are many who have belief in a Divine Spirit through non-Christian traditions.  We are not evil, we are not dark, and we don't disbelieve in the most Divine. We may use different words, but we still walk in the Light of Truth.

In this book, we have the story of English officer Ian Cameron following his rescue from two years of captivity in Central Asia.  All three books have as their basis happenings in that area of the world although most of Book #1 Silk and Shadows takes place in England.  During Ians imprisonment, he suffered mental, emotional and physical deprivation and torture including crippling beatings resulting in the loss of one of his eyes.  During much of that time, he was incarcerated in a deep dark pit along with a Russian officer who, after his death, tasked Ian with the delivery of his journal to his niece, Larissa Alexandrovna Karelian (Laura).

***Spoilers***
Lauras in India and that just happens to be where Ian plans to travel in order to try and pick up where his life left off previous to his captivity.  Before his captivity, he was engaged to be married to a lovely English Rose named Georgina and hes pinned much of his hopes for the completion of his rehabilitation upon the joy he will have in his life with Georgina.  Well, as these kinds of hopes go, this one simply doesnt work out since she thought he was dead and therefore moved on.  So now Ians struggles become even worse especially when he realizes hes missing out on one thing thats long been a primary part of any young healthy man's life   that would be sexual desire.  Yep, the beatings and kickings have rendered him impotent resulting in a severe depression.

In the meantime Lauras got problems of her own.  Her beloved English Officer stepfather has just passed away while the two of them were out and about taking care of his business in the Indian countryside.  This is where Ian finally catches up with her in order to deliver her uncles diary.  They become friends on their journey back to civilization; have some great adventures which include killing a man eating tiger and so on.  Laura has issues of her own that deal with a fear of sexual passion which she believes damaged her parents relationship and resulted in her fathers death by suicide.  So, although shes very attracted to men in general and Ian in particular, she plans to never be married.  So, we can see where this is heading.  What better way than to have some type of life together by entering into a white marriage since he cant and she wont.

So this is the basis of the story and I found it to be very unique and was enjoying it greatly until of course Ian gets well and wakes up with a very strong urge and Lauras reasons and fears for not wanting a real marriage simply become boring.  Thankfully, she takes counsel with a wise maharani who educates her in these matters so this hindrance to the story doesnt last any longer than necessary.  Ultimately, there is a huge military undertaking that will crush the English army resulting in Ian and Laura getting to save the day but not before Ian finds himself undergoing a huge challenge to his last remaining fear.

328,4,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,B005FIN9YG,"Elmo Jenkins is a seminary student, and one the requirements for graduation is a six-month internship with a church. Ditched by his date at a fancy party, Elmo meets one of the ministers of the fabled First Church, and lands his internship.

First Churchs denomination isn't mentioned. It could be Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, or a similar group. If youve grown up within the boundaries of Protestant Christianity in the United States, the church is instantly recognizable  the megachurch with the big tall steeple usually located right in the middle of downtown.

Elmos office is (literally) a transformed broom closet in a large complex of offices. He begins to navigate his way through both the building and the churchs labyrinthine internal politics, politics that extend to the local business community, the seminary, and the country club. All-too-human frailties have to be dealt with. A minor 100-year-old mystery needs solving. And theres even the possibility of romance; actually, theres more than a possibility.

Ordained Irreverence is the first of four Elmo Jenkins novels and four novellas by McMillian Moody. Moody, who lives in Tennessee (where there are any number of First Churches to choose from), has taken a humorous yet rather fond look at institutions like First Church and the characters who inhabit them  the senior pastor, the trusted assistant pastor, the worship leader, and all the other people who comprise the staff of a large church.

Moodys intent isn't to poke fun and puncture balloons, but he clearly knows enough about churches to know that First Church isn't a completely fictional creation. What keeps the book from drifting into sarcasm is the understanding that, despite all the egos and foibles on display, Gods work is somehow getting done.

We can laugh at the inside church jokes and punctured egos, but Moody keeps returning us to the purpose of the church, and to the fact that even large churches, once you're past the glitter and theatrics, can serve good purposes. Elmo may be irreverent, but he knows what he and the church are called to do.","Humorous, fond look at big churches",7,2016-09-15

We all know this to be true, if you don't care for romance novels, then don't read them.

With this particular story I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There were twists and turns.  At points I cheered the characters on,  scowled at them for their immaturity in handling some situations, and took the journey with them in this book.  I also enjoyed some of the secondary characters such as Fannie, a married woman who wants everyone to have the happiness she found by being a matchmaker.  I also enjoyed that Sophie our heroine was a smart, intellectual sort,  and for a historical novel I found that refreshing!  The ending was definitely not expected, and for once I didn't find the ending rushed as I normally do with novels.  I thought it was well written, and the twist was a nice touch.

Even if the first book was free, reading the book chapter by chapter at 99 a pop cost me $5.

I won't be doing that again, especially since the second book was almost as short as the first one and the other four were not much bigger. I will say the storyline has promise though.

This was a fast paced, crazy, funny soap opera with well-developed characters and a plot that will leave you guessing and second guessing the outcome until the very end.  The characters have so many layers and the omniscient writing style lets you root and hope for all the characters.  I want the good guys to win but felt for the bad guys too.  Its a mind teaser that has you putting yourself in each characters shoes.  There is a heavy plot peppered with a bunch of subplots full of action and drama.  I actually was doing the DUN-DUN-DUUUUN!!! sound out loud.  It was funny and quirky without coming off stupid or droll.

There is some cursing, nothing you won't hear on FOX, and some sexual content, pretty light though and not smutty, and there is some blood shed but really not that gruesome but action and suspense all around.

I have to say that the first The Heat books in the bundle, I could not tell the bad guy from the good guy; as the heroines are ill treated by both.

I can take an alpha man, but the need for abuse and the heroine supposedly getting off on the dirty talk by her kidnapper was too much for me.

The sort of ""Romy and Michelle"" premise of a woman attending her reunion pretending to be something she is not--in this case, a detective- had a lot of potential, but I'm not certain the book actually achieved its goal.  It was nice to see a middle-aged woman as a well-rounded individual, sexual interests and all, but I actually found some of the characters on the periphery more interesting than the main character (i.e., the owner of the motel, the main character's two best friends).  They added a bit of comedy to what was otherwise a fairly dry tale. There were a LOT of characters, too, and sometimes it was difficult to keep them all straight, especially since so many of them had similar-sounding names, or names that began with the same letter (Rolly, Lolly, Christine, Carolyn, Murial, Missy...)  I wish all authors everywhere would learn to avoid that bad habit when writing!

367,3,A1YZCADBVKWC9X,B005L35E3O,"Read it for free. Thanks to the author for making it available to read for free.

Basically hero and heroine  are from two different cultures (hero human and heroine alien). They are translating and helping with negotiations for peace. They form an odd friendship. However, things turn for the worst when heroine is attacked by another alien that wants to mate with her so he can become king. Hero saves her but at a cost. To return favor heroine forms a bargain with hero so he can live and she will be free from forceful suitors. They mate but there are many obstacles  standing in the way of the couple (interfering family, heroine's father killed, hero being jerk because of old baggage he caries, heroine doesn't know how to feel, and  lack of communication).

This was a unique read. Heroine was very cold (literally and figurate). It goes with the personality of her people. Hero was physically attracted to her and somehow found her uptight and cold personality charming. He even says he missed her ""cold"" body pressing against him during their separation. It was out there let me tell you.

Also, hero himself was getting over a divorce. So he also had faults like comparing heroine to his ex when she was nothing like her. Takes a friend, that I could not understand why they were friend's since he slept with hero's ex wife, to tell him to his face he was being a jerk. In the end it was the heroine that makes effort to return with hero and apologizes. So even thought she was cold, she makes more effort to be with him than hero.

On side note, found the whole scenes with the little queen/king weird. Hero somehow friend's her and she later tells heroine she would take him  for  a mate. I swear there was more connection between  little queen/king and hero, than hero and heroine. Oh they say I love you, but I didn't feel it. There is a lost connection between hero and heroine. Felt it was the personality of the heroine and baggage  hero carried that didn't allow for that connection to form during the story.

It okay. If you like unique alien stories this could be for you. It has an almost rape scene, but no real details given, and one sexual scene that was different, for lack better word, than any I have read. Never found a cold body sexy. I thought those things shrunk in the cold (if you get my drift). Anyway, it ends with a HEA.",It was unique.,2,2016-06-29

I could not find any humor in this book that is described as ""funny"". What the characters look like is not clear and for the most part one is reading a book about people (or aliens) that are blurry in one's mind. There are very simple but also very annoying just plain mistakes in the book (like: why does the bodyguard of the alien daughter understand the human language if she is, supposedly, the only one who speaks it?)
I do not know whom to recommend a book like this to - I would assume that Linnea Sinclair fans would expect more.",the fun in this funny romance is definitely missing,4,2016-02-14
369,4,ADBYZRQ6DL86H,B005LC1NGW,"TITLE: A Rogue by Any Other Name
AUTHOR: Sarah MacLean
SERIES: Rules of Scoundrels, Book 1
SETTING: early 1830s (post-Georgian, pre-Victorian), mostly London
THEMES/TROPES: old friends-to-lovers, coerced marriage, revenge, redemption, spinster, heartless hero, reformed rake, gaming hell

OVERVIEW:
Lady Penelope Marbury has languished in Society for several years after a broken engagement placed her desirability in question, turning down a handful of so-so suitors and, without realizing it, putting her sisters futures in jeopardybut her father is determined that its time she married. Hes added a valuable piece of land, newly acquired, to Penelopes dowry, and the suitors are about to come pouring in. Though she knows she wants more than a bland Society marriage, Penelope is ready to accept a proposal from an old friend and settle into a comfortable life.

That is, until another old friend, Michael, Lord Bourne, comes bursting back into her life, determined to have her dowry: the ancestral land that he lost on a foolish bet years earlier. Bourne has spent several years focused on two things, regaining his land and seeking revenge against the man who took it from him, and a wife seems a small price to pay to achieve at least one of those goals. His plan, however, did not account for the fact that the bride in question is the one woman who knew him before he was the dark, hardened Bournewhen he was happy, carefree Michael. Nor did he consider that his revenge might be something that hurts Penelope. And he certainly didn't consider that he might care about hurting her. It all comes down to a decision between the goal hes been chasing for so longas goal that has hardened his heartand giving Penelope the love and adventure that shes always wanted.

PROS:
Love developing between old friends is one of my favorite romance archetypes, so this storyline automatically appealed to me. The concept of Bournes goals, and his guilt and shame at having lost his land to begin with, are a fabulous background for the story because it puts him and Penelope in a position where theyve been separated for years and become very different people. Not only do they need to rediscover one another and their friendship, but his drive for revenge propels the drama between them.

The two characters are both well-rounded and interesting, and their relationship develops at a good pace. Penelope is finding the gumption to seek some adventure in her life, but shes not throwing propriety to the wind because she wants to help her sisters make good matches more than anything. Bourne is infused with a good amount of devil-may-care attitude with hints of solicitousness to show that hes not truly heartless. I like that he has a major screw-up in his past because so many heroes are so infallible. Bourne is constructed as a very driven character, so it felt believable that once he found a goal that brought out the best in him (namely, love and family), his drive would make him strive to be better.

The pace of the romance is fairly good, with plenty of trust issues because of the charade of a love match they put on for Society to make their marriage look less scandalous. Because they spend so much time pretending to be in love, there are points when the emotional progression feels a little redundanthe cares about me  no, that was just pretend  but he does seem to care  no, that was just acting againbut those emotional circles mostly make sense in the plot.

One detail of this book that I love is the use of letters as epigraphs for each chapter, starting with letters between Penelope and Bourne when they were quite young and continuing to letters from Penelope that he never answered and then to letters that Penelope kept writing but never sent.

CONS:
The one aspect of Bourne that I found a little perplexing was his very insistent belief that he and his life aren't good enough for Penelope. Perhaps if we got more information on the things he had done during the years when he was trying to earn back his lost fortune, this might make more sense, but the glimpses we get of the gaming hell he co-owns, particularly some details about how well-regulated it is and how well they treat their employees, does not paint a picture of a particularly dark life.

The plot was very much focused on their emotional progression, which is not necessarily a con in itself, but the plot could have had more interest by being a bit more eventful. I would have liked a bit more of Bourne and Penelope interacting with secondary characters. I usually love secondary characters, and I did enjoy Cross, one of Bournes partners, but there just wasn't a lot of the other characters in this story.

RATINGS:
Writing: 4/5 MacLeans writing is consistently good.
Characters: 5/5 Well-rounded and interesting.
Plot: 4/5 Could have been a bit more eventful.
Setting: 4/5 Bournes gaming hell is nicely detailed.
Romance: 5/5 I love a friends-to-lovers story.
Sexiness: 5/5 Well-written and integrated with romance.
Humor: 3/5 Touches of humor, but not much laugh-out-loud.
Average: 4.28 Great Romance Development between Old Friends

OTHER INFO:
This is the first of MacLeans Rules of Scoundrels series, each book focusing on one of the four owners of the gaming hell called The Fallen Angel. Penelope previously appeared in the Love by Numbers series as the betrothed of the Duke of Leighton, the hero of the third book, and their broken engagement plays a big role in how she got to the place shes at in this book. Reading that book before this one isn't necessary, but I would recommend reading this book before moving on to the rest of the series because this book gives good background on Penelopes sister Pippa, who is the next heroine in this series, paired with Bournes co-owner, Cross.",Great Romance Development between Old Friends,2,2017-07-30
370,5,A1GFLH8WYLHXZM,B005LC1NGW,"My favorite trope! Childhood besties! Michael and Penelope were the best of friends on adjoining estates. Life was good. Along with their buddy, Tommy, their young lives were filled with fun and adventure. That is, until life happened.

This story delves into the aftermath of loss, separation, grief, greed and vengeance. I especially enjoyed the running commentary provided by letters from home to and from the young Michael and Penelope while he was away at Eton. They emphasized the bond shared by the two friends.

This was somewhat of a dark story as the hero behaved a lot like a villain throughout most of the story. I really couldn't blame his anger and search for vengeance, but crikey, these are your friends and you want vengeance by any means necessary even at the expense of the ones who love you? Sheesh, Bourne!

Sarah MacLean takes us on a journey into the minds of her characters and you find that they are so well written that you will forgive them their foibles in their journey to HEA.

The ultimate villain in this story didn't receive the true comeuppance that he deserved. He was a vile man who deserved to be ruined, but instead seemed to break even. Maybe I'm just more vengeful than the characters.

Because I'm on a reread binge, I did note a couple of inconsistencies - Donovan West versus Duncan West in a later novel. There were several references to the number of ""men"" in the room and skewed gender references in several instances.

This book is a keeper for me and I enjoyed the reread thoroughly. It has been a few years so it was good to revisit these characters in anticipation of next month's new release.",Bourne and Penelope,3,2017-05-27

373,1,A1ZJO1QUDD3TI6,B005LVV6DI,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The amount of brand names mentioned made it read like an ad for some sort of high priced mall than a book and, at times, it felt like Knight was writing her description around the product brand. Rachel couldn't even just grab a granola bar, it had to be a Nature Valley granola bar. She can't just use eye shadow, it has to be Maybelline and I actually had to Google what a Filofax was. Turns out it isn't some sort of manila folder. It's a planner. Why couldn't she have just said it was a planner?

Aside from that, Knight spent quite a bit of time talking about Rachel's family only to have them virtually disappear shortly after. Her parents were terribly concerned about her sophomore-aged well-being but also allow her senior-aged sister spend the weekend at a college with her boyfriend? That's absolutely bizarre. I may not be a parent, but I'm pretty sure that's a bizarre combination. For the first half of the book, Rachel had to ask her parents for everything, then all of a sudden she's staying after school getting stood up by a boy and going to the same friends' house her parents told her not to hang out with anymore to get ready for a dance. It was set up for there to be some sort of rivalry between Rachel and her sister, Sarah, but nothing ever came from that even after Sarah made the cheer squad and Rachel didn't. Mark was even more pointless than Sarah and disappeared before the book even really started.

Rachel was low-key threatened by mean girl, Arielle, since the second day of school but, not only does Arielle never fulfill any of her threats, she disappears. Benji and Rob showed up at bizarre times and Rachel's insta-love with them was ridiculous. The only reason Rachel knew Rob's last name was because of the back of his jersey and she's already writing her first name with his last? Alright. Benji just appears, takes Rachel to her favorite place ever, saves her life then refuses to answer any of her questions. She does anything he asks of her to see him and then rides off with him into the sunset after he beats the crap out of her quasi-boyfriend and his homies? K.

None of the characters were developed and Rachel was basically 3 different Rachel's in 160 pages. The tri-Rachel's weren't even written as though she was coming to terms with who she is so much as if Knight had forgotten what Rachel's personality was supposed to be. First, she was a girl set up to have some sort of rivalry with her sister because they're complete opposites-Sarah's so thin and Rachel's not thin, not fat, but average, then she's a smart, athletic (lettering in FOUR sports), and put together young lady who wants to be on the science team and plays by all the rules because she feels bad for lying to mommy and daddy followed by being boy crazy, sneaking out of the house, ditching school and running off into the night with strange boys.

The hero and heroine have different ways to attract their fellow college students to their respective Christian groups. One is more about fun and the other about hard-core Bible study. They also have different fishing styles in the contest. They come to realize they have different ""fishing"" styles but the same overall goal. I enjoyed this aspect of the story.

The hero and heroine had a misunderstanding back when the heroine's apparent boyfriend (and hero's brother) died in an accident. There's a lot of pain connected to that past event, and they never cleared up the misunderstanding. It's now a matter of having some time together and finally talking about the wrong ideas they got back after the accident.

Even back in 2011 Ms. Warren wrote brilliantly with characters that are real, and ones you care for.

394,4,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B005OLSNOK,"Johnny Truant is somewhat of a Renaissance man, having written a number of science fiction novels and guides to publishing, as well as being a former motivational speaker. That motivational speaking background is quite evident in ""Disobey,"" one of a series of free, short essays about the author's philosophy of life that are available on Amazon.

""Disobey,"" which originally appeared as a blog post, sounds like a talk that a motivational speaker might give, one that revs up his audience to do something. In this case, the something he wants the audience, or more precisely, his readers to do, is evident by the title, to break the rules. Truant, however, is not a wild-eyed anarchist who wants to tear down society; instead, he's got some very specific suggestions and some rather well thought out reasoning behind them. In essence, he's somewhere between a garden-variety nonconformist and an out-and-out anarchist.

Truant starts the book by describing an example of his own rule breaking: home schooling his son in accordance with an extremely unconventional educational philosophy. He then recounts his own history of playing by the rules and where it got him (Hint: It didn't go too well).  And then, Truant had his epiphany about the rules and peoples reaction to them. Namely, that the rules we live by are not like laws of nature. You cant choose not to obey the law of gravity and thereby float in the air; you can choose not to obey societys rules and risk societys scorn for doing so. Further, following the rules doesnt mean good things will follow, just that people are more or less normal. And by normal, Truant means conformist.

In reviewing Disobey, I don't want to judge it by how much I agree or disagree with Truants suggestions. Instead, I think the proper standard is how well he writes and lays out his arguments. And, by those standards, the book is quite effective. Truant has a way with words, writing conversationally and colloquially, with a good bit of wit (and, be forewarned, a few four-letter words as well). He backs his arguments with a few facts (which may or may not be accurate since he doesnt annotate the book), but Disobey never comes across as a scholarly or political diatribe.

Like the other books in this series, Disobey is free on Amazon, so readers cant complain about the value of something theyve paid for. And Truant writes in a witty, breezy style, so the book makes for a quick, easy read that may even garner a chuckle or two. Readers can agree or disagree with his proposals and decide whether to try them out themselves. But there are far worse ways to spend 10 minutes on Amazon rather that reading Truants tract.

If you walk around every day on eggshells, nervous about making a mistake or looking stupid, then you should read this.

If you have a ""next big thing"" in mind you want to do because you know it will be awesome (starting the business, making the big move, launching the nonprofit, writing the book) but are afraid of doing what it would take to make that thing happen, then you should read this.

The universe is very big. You are very small. In fact, you're so small and so insignificant in the big picture that you don't even register to the eye of the cosmos. The universe was here before you were born and will be here long after you're gone, and your life is but a blip on its vast, vast radar. If your life is to matter, it's not going to matter to the universe. It's up to you make your life matter in the only way you can: by doing things that make a difference to you, to those around you, and to those whose lives you touch. Time is short. You have exactly NOW to do whatever it is you're here to do, or to let the inexorable passage of hours and days and years kill your potential like fruit left to die on a vine.

The universe doesnt hate you, but it doesnt love you, either. Youre just an atom in its infinite workings. The universe doesnt care if you live, die, suffer, or thrive. Whatever your life here will mean is up to you.

402,3,A29MCZ55V6XTBV,B005OMBTKY,"Well, not really.
The author does have a point regarding 'take action and be all you aspire to be', but the point is rather weak.

Telling you that the pain you feel from a disease or an accident is nothing because it's just an electric current in your
nerves is exactly where this book fails. It describes things intelligently indeed but in an objective manner, whereas
our experiences are subjective.

Maybe, maybe it will trigger a Quantum Leap in Energy and elevate few readers' lives - deserving a 3-Star for that  -,
but for 99% of us responsible, careful, REALISTIC people, taking bold steps and trying to live out our fantasies
is a prescription for failure.

For the author, failure, pain or suffering as a result of ones actions are of no importance to the 'Universe' and 'pale
in comparison to the grandeur of time and space' , but that's ridiculous and takes things out of context.

Physical pain is real to the person who has it. Being poor because of not sticking to a job is detrimental to the affected person.
Becoming solitary because you decide to be totally different in a weird way etc. are serious impairments on individuals
as well as society.

The middle way is the right way. Unless you are Steve Jobs, or Elon Musk, or Einstein, stay within the comfort zone and
the common rules of society to thrive, and in your own free time feel free to invent, start your company, meditate or any other
creative path you want to take. The great Einstein himself kept his job at the Swiss Patent Office while developing his Specific

I'm not gonna say it was all a fun ride because there was genuine emotional turmoil included, but that just helped to make it such a good book. This world's use and acceptance of the reality of magic was seamless. It never seemed out of place for someone to be able to create symbols and unleash the elements.

Isabella is a strong and intelligent woman, as someone in her line of work should be. Her tools of the trade mix traditional spy gear with magical gear. She has emerald glasses that let her see in the dark. She has red garnet lipstick that, when kissed, allows her influence over the kisser. A wonderful blend of spy and magic gear.

My favorite part of this book is the entire cast and crew of characters. It's so easy to feel for the people she meets behind the lines, the people who have lost everything, the people who are tired of fighting but continue to do so. It is written in such a way that much of the history of World War II is still there, there's just magic involved as well. The people of Britain are still conserving every ounce of food and cooking with even the most disliked ingredients (liver sandwiches, bleh). The people of France are on strict rations with curfews and are killed on the streets if suspected of any Marquisard activities or sympathies. This book almost brought me to tears through its characters.

All of this and I've barely scratched the surface the Grey Tower vs the Black Wolves! The Order versus ""vampires"" that drink the blood of wizards to gain their energy. Plus, the hunt for Isabella's father who is believed to be a Drifter, a magician who can travel through time. There is just so much going on in this book, but it is so well balanced that it never feels overwhelming. It never feels like the author is skipping over important details.

This was a great read. If you like magic-in-the-real-world, or fictional stories set in World War II, or stories about magical forces at war with each other, I highly recommend this book.

The humor and quirkiness seem to come from the setting (new age wilderness wedding) than from the dialogue.

He wasn't supposed to actually win and kill a Deathless! Siris returns home with the God Kings Infinity Blade expecting a heros welcome, but instead he finds himself tactfully, but firmly, exiled and wandering away. Turns out the people of his village are afraid hes only going to attract hordes of other Deathless in search of the blade. So Siris sets off towell, hes still trying to figure that out. Along the way he runs into Isa, a fortune hunter/assassin he gets along with pretty well when they aren't trying to kill one another, and TEL, a golem someones obviously sent to spy on him. And on the journey Siris starts to figure out some surprising things about the God King, the Infinity Blade, and himself.

Let's be honest, books inspired by video games just don't scream original or quality literature. So even though I'm a huge Brandon Sanderson fan, this novella has been low on my to-read list. At least it was until a friend (also a Sanderson fan) told me it was his favorite of Sanderson's shorter stories. Even so, after getting this for Christmas it's taken me two months to get around to reading it. And of course, now I'm kicking myself. This was indeed a fun and intriguing read. I know absolutely nothing about the game it relates to, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything in the story. I liked Siris and all his complexities. I didn't quite see the twist in his story coming for a little while. I really liked Isa. She's fun and spunky, and just crazy enough you never can quite predict what she'll do next. And then there's TEL, he was an unexpected but very fun arrival. Nothing like a worry wort golem to provide some humor. So yes, I enjoyed it and I've got the next Infinity Blade novella primed and ready on my Kindle. Perhaps my only qualm with the story was it was too short. I wanted to explore the world more, even though I know full well that asking Sanderson for more is asking for something that can also double as a door stop.

I am very displeased with the presence of DRM on this book. For more information about DRM, see drmfree.calibre-ebook.com/about#drm.
Basically, it is a scheme to prevent piracy of E-Books (or other digital media) that is a huge hassle for legitimate readers (In short, you don't REALLY own the book, so it can be taken from you at any time, and you can't back it up or read it on any other device if you did) and in most cases, can be easily circumvented by illegal means and Google, so the pirates can do what they like but the legitimate readers like myself can't.

The book is well-written and well-edited, and the plot is full of twists and turns (and not merely surprises relating to the mystery).  Each time I thought I'd figured out the relationships between the characters, or surmised what had happened or was about to happen, I was surprised.  The dialogue is delightful, full of quick repartee.  While not laugh-out-loud funny, there are a lot of amusing scenes, and there are almost as many that are a touch heart-breaking.

421,2,ABW8ZL231G2TP,B005UGMC78,"This story draaaagggggsssss on until I pretty much didn't care anymore.  It is simplistic to the point of annoyance.  The heroine goes to a bar at the beginning of the story with the express purpose of picking up a man in order to prove her libido still works after an abusive marriage.  Got it.  When she is successful, she throws away the opportunity (literally.  She tears up his number and throws it away.)  Why bother with this episode?  Oh yeah: so she can run into him in the new town she moves to and vacillate about whether or not to pursue anything with him.  Frankly, the majority of the story is boring.  Not having read any of the other Six Pack books, I was sometimes confused about which Coleman family had which sons.  The interjection of other Coleman families was confusing and unnecessary; Gabe is or is not going to transform his (apparently cruel father's?) ranch into a more financially viable organic ranch?

422,5,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B005UGMC78,"A stand alone read with a HEA.  It is part of a series but each book seems to be able to read individually.  This is a big family of ranchers.  All men living a man's life.  It is set in Canada in a small town.  Naturally the men are all men!!  They are rough, rough speaking, and lusty!!  it seems like a great bunch to me.  Sometimes the way of speaking makes them sound stupid when I don't think they are stupid at all.  The constant use of the word ain't seemed to make them appear uneducated.  Some have gone to college some stopped school at high school.

The hero is second oldest at 26.  He is quite the lusty fellow, he obviously knows his way around a woman's body and he loves sex.  Not a bad trait to my way of thinking.  He is at a point in his life where he is ready to get serious and wants the woman that is to be his life partner.  he has a secret that he is afraid will scare most women off.  Except the ones just looking for a good time.  He is tired of the good time girls.

The heroine, Beth, is a young widow with 3 young sons.  She finally escaped a very abusive marriage.  She was beaten down as well as beat!  She was very sexually repressed and had all the scars to show for it.  She was wearing a leg brace from injuries she suffered in a car wreck.  She is a school teacher with a strong spirit and she is determined to start a new life in a new town and get her family back on good, happy terms.  She meets the hero in a bar and later winds up living in a cabin on his families ranch.

There is a lot of wild sex in this story.  I would give it an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  So, if that is an issue for you, be warned.  In the context of this story the sex fit.  He was slowly showing her that sex could be fun and fulfilling.  He was just the cowboy for this job.  He had moves I had never heard of.  This man has it going on.  Plus, he has a heart of gold.  He is compassionate, loving, kind and perfect for the heroine.

Again, this is small town living, running a ranch with his brothers and dad.  They are not big city millionaires so the atmosphere of the book is indicative of that scene.  I really enjoyed the story.  One reader quit at a very early part and I think she missed a good story by not continuing.  But to each his own.,  I just think it is unfair to give a book a low rating and advise people not to read it when you haven't even finished the first chapter but everyone has a right to do what they feel is right.  I highly recommend the book.  I thought it was interesting and entertaining.  I believe the other brothers in this series will get stories just as good as this one.  They are all very interesting brothers, each with their own set of issues and things to work out in their lives.  A good read.

Wanting to start over and give her sons a better life, Beth moves to a small town in Calgary where she has a teaching job. It turns out that Beth moves into a spare house on the Coleman ranch and Daniel is a Coleman. When he finds out Beth is there, he is determined to win her over and not let her get away this time. She agrees to be friends with him with the condition they have 'non-vanilla' sex. What man would turn down a friends with benefits deal? Not Daniel. But he wants more from her so he slowly starts to break down her barriers.

I loved this story and the ranch setting. But Daniel was the best part of this book, IMO. He's a strong alpha male who is incredible in bed but so tender and caring to Beth and her sons. You just have to love him. He is my favourite book-boyfriend.

You have to admire a man who is so dedicated to helping a woman achieve her sexual fantasies. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it. But then he slowly inserts himself into her life. Even spending time with her boys and being a role model without even realizing it. He knows Beth had a lot of demons to get over after her life with her abusive husband so he has to be careful how he handles everything with her if he wants her to let him into her life.

When her friend Carley says oh that's just how Holt and his family are. They are popular and rich they don't hang around others.

Autumn is your typical teenager with way too much parental baggage. She knows way more than any teenage should know about her parents and the fact that she doesn't even want to be around them doesn't surprise me. So she goes to visit her best friend in Maine.

Holt is mysterious and kind of creepy. He just showed up at the airport when Autumns friend didn't bother to pick her up. It isn't like her friend sent Holt to get her, he just appeared. This entire airport scene is kind of baffling to me since there was no reason for Holt to be at the airport.

Samuel. He is mysterious and misleading. When he first meets Autumn, he is off standish and ignores Autumn. After some time, he actually starts to talk to Autumn and I think he might actually like her. However, I think Autumn was so wrapped up with him being ""mean"" and ""hating her"" that she seems to like Holt more.

Declan only wants to marry her off to a suitable man in order to protect her and her estate from unscrupulous men like her cousin, who wants the property for himself. Declan though, finds her spirited nature and beauty a challenge.
Will they get past their self-imposed barriers and discover love? Or will outside plots do the pair in before they can admit their true feelings?

434,3,A1WK64OV93G9TA,B005VH9IPK,"This is the usual historical romance, Georgian in this case. Pretty much formulaic. Beautiful but stubborn heiress in danger from greedy despicable relative who wants to marry her for her money and estate which he thinks he should have inherited, meets handsome man who has agreed to protect her until she is married to man of her choice; but, she falls in love with him and he swears he will never marry her. He is damaged from childhood emotional trauma and she thinks she can teach him to love. Blah blah blah...  I don't mind stories that follow a formula if the writing is good and in this case it isn't bad, but, the editing is terrible. H asks his aunt and cousin to be chaperones to the h and at one point they are at a ball and the text refers to them as his mother and sister; next paragraph they are his aunt and cousin again. Pronouns are confused such as he used when it should have been she, and vice versa. Frequently there is no separation between scene changes so you will be reading along and all of a sudden you realize one scene ended and another started but there was no extra spacing or a printed symbol to show the change. Many historical  inaccuracies such as h is allowed to meet with a man even without the usual chaperone of a maid. The H guardian often comes into her room at night without even knocking on the door because he wants to talk to her about something. She sleeps in the nude--back in those days women often didn't even bathe in the nude. But that way the H can see she is naked and get aroused--seems contrived. Guardian kisses her passionately often--not much of a guardian. Of course they are going to fall in love, it is telegraphed from the beginning. There is no suspense. Guardian lusts after h from pretty much the beginning, too, so you know there is going to be sex before marriage. The sex scenes are not terribly explicit but they have been caught kissing so many times the whole household has to know what is going on but no one objects--not even the aunt or cousin who are supposed to be there to protect the h's honor.

Dragon Warrior is book one in the Dragon Wars series by Shea MacLeod.

I waspleasantlysurprisedwith how much I enjoyed this post-apocalyptic adventure. The author thinks outside the box and brings together severaluniqueelements. 

I picked this one up; because of the title and the free status. I love dragon's and was expecting something along the lines of a dragon shifter in hiding or like the movie Dragonheart, but what I got was completelydifferentin that the dragon's are truefire breathingdragon's.

I enjoyed the worldbuilding, plot, Rain and Micah together andseparately. I wassurprisedby many events and plot twists and turns. The character andworldjump off the pages. The author does afabulousjob getting the reader invested into the characters created and pulling you into thisinterestingworld where dragon's are bad, humans fight for their lives not from just the dragon's, but from anothersourcethat once served to protect, and so much more.

The ending iswonderfullydone. Even though we are left with a little cliffhanger and some questions, they just add to the story making me want to pick up the next book to see what happens next, what is reveled, and how will these people change the status quo.

The only thing I felt needed to happen is that things needed to slow down a little more. Without giving things away, some major events happenbeforethebeginningof the book including a potential villain. The way this isshownto us left me hungry for more.

came to Socrates Cheng (Penn St.; China Studies major; Columbia U; JD, former attorney) a visit.
Chairman Chiang Kai-sheks $2200, 1927, Mandarin Yellow Parker duofold treasured fountain pen had been stolen from Li Bing-fas Three Prosperities China Arts Gallery (Georgetown).
Chairman Mao later had taken possession of it.

Li Bing-jade (Jade Li, Penn St. U; BA China Studies, Wellesley College; MS & PhD Philosophy Degree professor Georgetown U) was Li Bing-fas daughter, & Socrates GF.
That did not set well with dad at all, he disowned her.
Socrates parents are: Phillip Cheng (father, Chinese) & Sophia Cheng (mother, Greek).
The Washington Post headline read Chinese Embassys Diplomat Murdered in Chinatown.
Iris Hua (Lindas gallery director supervisor), & Linda Fong (asst. director) were employed at the Art Gallery.

The cultural exhibit show could not go on without that pen.
What did the note say that Socrates received?
Socrates had gone to the gallery several times to speak with the employees.
The next time he returned Iris had been murdered.
Detective Harte & Detective Thigpen (Metropolitan PD) had arrived at the crime scene.
Now FBI SA Ingram wanted to speak with Socrates.

Will the crime get solved & someone brought to justice?

I did not receive any type of compensation for reading & reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers & authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review. Only an honest one.

A very awesome book cover, great font & writing style. A very well written international crime thriller book. It was very easy for me to read/follow from start/finish & never a dull moment. There were no grammar/typo errors, nor any repetitive or out of line sequence sentences. Lots of exciting scenarios, with several twists/turns & a great set of unique characters to keep track of. This could also make another great international crime thriller movie, or better yet a mini TV series. There is no doubt in my mind this is a very easy rating of 5 stars.

441,2,A39VYGNHLXAVMP,B005Y0NHTM,"I gave this book two stars, because there was some interesting topics explored, and the writing was adequate, without too many errors. However, if the book had been well-polished and edited, it would have been about 1/3 as long, as the author not only shows and tells everything, but then goes on to explain what has already been shown and told. Sometimes the author throws in the character's internal thoughts on what has been shown, told, and explained, as well. The main character's girlfriend never does just one thing; she winks, blows a kiss, and settles her flat bottom more firmly on the chair (I think the author thinks a ""flat"" bottom is sexy.). This may seem like a minor quibble, but believe me after a few scenes, the reader really begins to dread any time the girlfriend shows up. There is also an extraneous sub-plot about the main character's parents that is just sad, depressing, and makes the reader feel ashamed of the parents, and all for no reason, as it has nothing to do with anything else in the book. It doesn't even give insight into the main character's motivation or personality, although it does give the author the opportunity to further pad out the book.

The author obviously knows quite a bit about some of the subject matter and can't resist showing off that knowledge, even when it bogs down the story. Case in point - the Mandarin Yellow pen, as the titular item that has been stolen. A fake is introduced, and the fact that the pen is a fake would have been obvious to anyone with access to Google, but the author instead spends two pages going over ways the fake is similar to the real Mandarin Yellow, before pointing out the VERY obvious physical feature that shows it's a fake. When it comes time to reveal the mystery, the ""suspense"" is drawn out so long that is passes laughable and goes all the way to annoying.

Socrates: I will reveal the answers to all of your questions.
Villain: So tell us! If you can.
Socrates: Oh, I can! And I will!
End Chapter
Villain: So, whats the answer?
Socrates: It's very simple.
Villain: It must be, if you figured it out.
Socrates: You think you're very clever, but you made one mistake.
Villain: What mistake?
Socrates: I'll tell you.
Villain: So tell me.
Socrates: I will! After this suspenseful chapter ending!
End Chapter

Okay, so those lines aren't in the book, but you get the picture. After all that, the mystery is impossible to solve, as critical information is unavailable to the reader. The villain's motivation is paper-thin, and involves a complete personality change (although, I never did like the character, so perhaps the author did a better job than I give him credit for.). Despite that, there is little surprising about the Big Reveal, only another tedious recitation of facts that the reader had no access to and could have been delivered much more concisely.

I, personally, thought that naming the half-Chinese, half-Greek main character ""Socrates"" was a little cutesy. There are literally thousands of Greek names the author could have chosen that would have conveyed the character's mixed heritage, without becoming a cliche.

All in all, a disappointing read.",A tedious read,5,2017-01-04

Not to say that it was boring, just pointing out that, in a buffet line, there is more than one presentation because an audience usually has more than one flavor in mind.

Maddie Collins arrived in Texas after she inherited a old mansion that was sitting on a cattle ranch. She had inherited the house from a man that she had never met. He had been best friends with her dad, and owed him. Leaving the house to her, was paying off a debt that could never be paid off.  She was a very good chef, that worked in a Manhattan restaurant. The big-city girl feel in love with Texas and all it had to offer the first day. She had to stay in the house for 30 days. The only person she could sale the house too if she did not want it, was Boone Galagher.

Boone never got along with his dad.  He always dreamed of owning the ranch, and home one day. Now he finds out his dad left the house Maggie. The two has to share the house for 30 days. The chemistry between the two is instant. They both know a fling is the last thing that they should have. This could be a very long 30 days.

Maggie always moved around a lot growing up. She always wanted to belong some place. She had a craving for roots. For the first time she feels like she is home. Will she be able to walk away at the end of 30 days, and give the house to Boone? She knows how bad his father has hurt him. She is starting to really care for Boone. Sweet book.

Sample from chapter 8 - Maddie was always so relentlessly cheerful that he's come to think nothing could bring her low. To see that he was so very wrong struck him in a way that scattered his resolutions. Maddie needed someone. Right now, it would have to be him. She nestled into him and sobbed softly. Boone thought at that instant that he would slay dragons to bring back Maddie's smile.
Sample from chapter 10 - No words passed between them, but words weren't needed. Too often, words had driven them apart. Maddie slid her arms around Boone's wide chest and clung. Then the need for comfort melted like candle wax under the heat of a desire too long denied. She lifted her head and saw her yearning mirrored in his eyes.",Sweet romance,2,2016-02-01

Some authors are skilled with their descriptions, others with character development, others with plot. Elizabeth Marx is unusual in her mastery of emotions. Is she a perfect writer? No one is. There are some flaws in the book: punctuation and dialog attribution are two that come to mind. I sometimes had to backtrack to get it clear who was saying what. Those issues don't materially affect the reader's enjoyment of the story. Cutters vs. Jocks is a prequel to Binding Arbitration and, as such, it's a short read. It tugs at the reader's heartstrings and leaves one wanting to know more about the two main characters. Fortunately, Binding Arbitration is available. I hardly paused between finishing Cutters vs. Jocks and starting on the full length Binding Arbitration. My advice to anyone who enjoys romance: Buy this book!","By the time you realize you've started to care about the characters, it's too late! You'll be unable to stop reading.",3,2016-06-22

Oh wow, I loved Cutters Vs. Jocks! I adored the interaction between the hero and heroine most of the way through the book and on several occasions my heart strings were tugging away. The cutter vs jocks issue wasn't a big deal to me, only the growing love between the characters. I was only disappointed that Id have to wait to see what truly happens between them. I don't particularly like the idiocy of heroes that just sleep with the heroines without any protection and act like it never entered their head there could be repercussions. The author should always work the protection issue into the story instead of making their characters seem irresponsible. I was so engrossed in Cutters Vs. Jocks that when it came to the last pages I was crushed Id have to be on hold, waiting to find out what happens. I guess thats to the authors advantage though because you know Im going to go right out and get the continuing novel, Binding Arbitration! I suggest the reader buys it right along with Cutters Vs.

466,4,AN4B0UOJ3TLM3,B0064PJUWY,"Having read several of Elizabeth Marx's books, I have had this one in my Kindle app for a while but decided it was time to read it. Other books I've read by Marx were set in the South but Cutters vs Jocks is not. This one is set in Indiana.

Be sure, whatever you do, to read the blurb at the beginning that explains what cutters means. Having lived near a college town most of my life, I always heard of the town people being referred to as townies. Or I may have used the town versus gown dilemma. Cutters is an Indiana term that initially was in reference to stone cutting professionals.

Libby first meets Aidan while out for a night on the town. When the cutter girl beats the college jock at pool, he is taken with her. It turns almost obsessive in my mind but he pursues her like he has his baseball career in college.

I do not want to spoil the book but I will say that it left me wanting to know more. The book ends with graduation, when Aidan finds out that Libby is not just a cutter but also a graduate and a smart one.

The setting may be different from other Marx books I've read but Elizabeth Marx writes characters a reader becomes invested in and the reader wants more.

When he witnesses a murder on the train ride to Vienna, Austria, he is sucked into a whirlwind of death, danger, and daring. He and the beautiful Marie Andre, posing as his fiance, go to a tiny Austrian village very near the border of the Russian zone, where he finds a group of former Nazis living in the open, almost taunting him with their presence.
Dead Man Falling by Desmond Cory, is non-stop action a la James Bond, only, it takes place in the period immediately following World War 2, so there are no laser weapons or sleek cars, just good old fashioned guts and glory spying from the old school.
Cory paints a colorful picture of postwar Austria. He takes some liberties with history, for example, positing that Eva Braun bore Hitler a child, survived the Berlin bunker, and ended up in Austria with Hitlers teenage son. Youll be so caught up in the story, though, trying to identify the bad guys, you're likely, as I did, to forgive this bit of artistic license. Besides, he tied it up neatly, so history is safe.

I really loved it.  It is a book about sailboats and sailing as well as wine tasting and the growing of the grapes.  I don't know a lot about either so at times I was a little lost.  But the love story is great.  The hero is a professional photographer that has been very successful but is sort of tired of his life.  Since he was a child he has dreamed of sailing across the ocean.  As an adult he plans to do just that.  He is living in Washington state, has bought an old sailboat and is making her seaworthy.  He has not had a lot of luck with the ladies.  At least, not with a lasting relationship.  He gets plenty of action but it has never been anything that he has wanted long term.

The heroine has just lost her father.  It was just the two of them and they were very close.  He left her with a calendar and instructions to visit a new lighthouse, pictured in the calendar, each month.  On the first of each month she is to read a letter that he has left her.  She starts out on her journey to the first lighthouse on Puget Sound.  It is 1 January, cold and blistering cold.  As she is reading her first letter she spots a sailboat off in the distance.  The weather and sea is not even close to being safe for someone to be sailing.  But right before her eyes is this beautiful sailboat riding the waves.

This is the story of two people coming together first as total enemies that just rub each other the wrong way and can hardly stand to be in the same room together.  A lot of misconceptions are formed to make them think wrong thoughts about the other.  The story is really, really good.  At first I was a little lost but as the story starts to move along I got so caught up in it that I could not put it down.  There were a few times when I was really sad for her and her father, times when you laugh out loud at some of the hero's  blundering ways.  You love his little sea going cat!

He reminds me strongly of Bill Gastner, the ex-sheriff in Steven Havill's Posadas County series, set in the equally remote desert of border New Mexico. This was his first outing, though more are now on the shelves. What impressed me most was the way Mr. Collins kept all his large cast of characters distinct, a frequent problem in police procedurals. I was rarely confused as I read along; Mr. Collins clearly knows his narrative onions. Further, the story includes some refreshing situations, such as when Bud is injured in a gun battle, not because he is shot but because his horse is.

The setting is richly detailed. The author paints a vivid picture of life in Lake County, from the flora and fauna, to the weather conditions to the city of Lakeview, as well as a realistic description of the interactions of various law enforcement agencies, including Sheriffs Department, City Police, Oregon State Police, FBI, U.S. Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry and others.

Just another day in the life for Bill. That is, until Norman drops a bombshell. Norman tells Bill something which implicates the governor. Could it be true? The events definitely happened. Bill remembers them well. But was the governor involved? Bill is dragged into a mystery beyond his wildest dreams. His searching pulls him in so many ways that Bill isn't sure who is who anymore.

I began reading this novel, but when the plot turned away from Norman, I became a bit bored and set it aside. A few days later I decided to give the novel another chance and picked it back up. Just where I left off is where the action began. The novel picks up and takes the reader on a roller coaster ride. Just when Bill thinks his situation is cut and dried, he's face to face with revolutionaries. The novel takes the reader through a bit of Texas history that's both interesting and rarely seen in a history book.

Two things are irritating - the main human character, and the writing.

The main heroine, Lee, is emotionally inconsistent.  While she is a heroine to root for in the first parts of the book, she does not retain her emotional appeal in the latter part of the book.  She seems almost distant from the Derf parent who fought so hard for her.  Certainly not enough meaningful time is spent with the two.

But the most frustrating part is the writing.  I found myself editing paragraphs WHILE I was reading them!  Ouch!!!

508,4,A3HEG0QCOK446R,B006GZ1VU6,"This book was a little unorganized I'll admit.  Its more of a base intro about the series.  There are sooo many characters.  She sorta had to explain the different types of species and lay the ground work so to speak.  She could have done it differently yes but it was not horrible.  Yes, there were some boring parts, but its not as tragic as some reviewers indicated.  Surprisingly I read book 2 and on from there and never read this one until today.  LOL...I know right?

Elizabeth is a bit to take.  She's the female version of a manwhore to be honest.  I didn't like her much in this book.  She seemed immature and unbending.  She used 7 men/shifters/vamps....yes 7 men for sex and it was casual.  Yes, they seemed ok with that but over the years obviously they wanted more from her.  They were all regular lovers so of course there would be some feelings.  I think what bothered me and no it wasn't her having sex with so many but the fact she was so unfeeling and arrogant to not understand the ramifications of her actions to their feelings.  Then....she THOUGHT after the collaring that it would continue...um really?  Then of course her mates found out how many and that initially she thought of continuing her activities.  Naturally they were upset.  In her defense she didn't know it was a mating when she told a couple of the men she slept with on the regular.  Of course now that she mated with them she doesnt want anyone but Axe and Ash.  So, it was a bit of a mess there for awhile and it was her doing and her actions do have consequences.  It just irked me that she was so oblivious to her decisions that it wouldnt hurt anyone.  Arrogant.  I have to admit by the end she changed and I do like her.

509,1,AUF0OPKICU6D4,B006GZ1VU6,"I suppose my dislike of this book might just be a matter of taste. I dislike slut shaming and you would think that the fact that this MC was sleeping with 7 men and standing up for her right do so would be a good thing, but it wasn't. It rubbed me wrong for a couple reasons. First, they were the 7 most powerful men in the area, all fighting for her attention (the old she's so special for some unknown reason trope). Second, they bought her expensive gifts, like cars, and sent her the clothing they wanted her to wear on their 'dates.' By 25% I'd decided she read like a high class prostitute instead of a sexually liberated woman, like she was the cliche sexually available woman who therefore must be available to all powerful men. Third, she'd described as 18+3, so basically 18 (this is stressed that she's 18), making her a sexually promiscuous girl instead of woman. Fourth, the antagonist of the story is one of her jilted lovers and it's suggested that her sexual activity was to blame for the coven's problems (basically shaming her past activities). All this countered by five, after one good f_ck she settles down into marital bliss and it's ever so much better than playing the field. So the whole story is basically framed around how much better being in a committed relationship is than not. Maybe not slut shaming, but at the least admonishing. Then we have the oddity of it being stressed that bears DO NOT SHARE, therefore her sexual behavior would have to stop when she mated. Then she mated two bears who SHARE her. The MC's personality is only as deep as her bed sheets and the mates have none at all.",nope,3,2016-01-17

524,4,A372S9A7MJO1K8,B006KD2TP0,"This KA book is such a heartbreaker in so many ways. The h, Sadie, looks like a fairy princess but her father is a really bad guy. Her mother left when Sadie was eleven and she has not been seen since. Because Sadie's father is a crime boss, her life has been stifled and she has developed a cold, ice princess persona. The H, Hector, was undercover in her father's organization and was primarily responsible for getting him thrown into prison. Now she is unprotected and some very bad things happen to her one night. That's the setup for this story, which is really pretty good.

Here's the part I dislike, and it is a trope I hate. Hence the one star off.  If I have read this correctly, the H has a thing for the h. She is drunk one night and starts kissing the H. He then says something about her slumming with him, and she interprets that as him seeing her as a society sl*t. So she freezes up. After that is when her dad goes to prison, but H still supposedly has a thing for her. And of course, we then find out that the H has been smexing LOTS of women in the meantime. So many that when at a bar together, she actually meets one of those women who gives her a friendly warning about him, calling him a dawg. And that the other woman was with him 6 weeks ago, which coincides with the very bad thing that happened to the h.

My question is, and always has been, this - if the H is waiting for the h to make her move (which he said he was) then WHY do these guys nail as many women as they can in the meantime? They've known each other about 2 years or so. So OK, before they have even kissed I can understand it. But the H says he has been waiting for her for a long time. So again, my question is why can't they actually WAIT? The excuse given is that they weren't together then, so the h shouldn't feel bad. Right.

525,2,A2VDS6RU9H3BMG,B006KWAKDE,"If you combined the dystopian setting of Hunger Games books with the backbiting and forced melodrama of Mean Girls and The Bachelor TV series youd have The Selection.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games books, I find The Bachelor insipid and boring.  Unfortunately, The Selection is much more Bachelor than it is Hunger Games and because of that I am not inspired or motivated to continue the series even though book one leaves the reader hanging.

Below are some observations I noted as I read:
- Selection process reminiscent of Hunger Games series, but with less emotional engagement or risk
- The Princes selection process is The Bachelor model for selecting fiancs complete with dates.
- The heroine whines about everything that is different in her life resulting from her choice to participate in the selection.  She made the choice to participate to benefit her family so suck it up, buttercup.
- The dialogue often reads like Mean Girls in a girls locker room a month before prom: gossip, speculation, backbiting, wishful thinking, will he/wont he ask me  out; wild jealousy when girls talk about their respective dates with the Prince.
- Silly names for the new countries: Swendway, Honduragua; feels like the author couldn't be troubled with more detailed world building.

However, I am amazingly glad that she loaned me the book to read. First of all can we talk about that cover? Seriously, of the millions and millions of covers it seems like Ive seen, that is definitely near the top if not the top one.

Cass does a lovely job of incorporating so many different twists and turns and story lines into this one. At the beginning I wasn't quite so sure I would like it, seemed a bit too Bachelorette-esque for me. But I quickly fell in love with her voice and her characters. One things for sure, her main girl, America (ignore the name, I never said it was creative lol) is a kick-butt, I-dont-take-nonsense-from-anyone type, which I love. Girls aren't always simpering and weak and needing a guy to save her. True, she also doesnt often think before she acts, which does get her into some situations, but for the most part she works her way out.

While I did highly enjoy this one, I cant say for certain that I agree with the script that they were going to use for a television adaptation of it. Honestly, Im sincerely hoping that Cass signed away most of her rights and couldn't change anything about it, otherwise I lost a fair bit of respect for her. She weaves this wonderful tale full of creativity, and then lets a TV network pick it apart and make it far more inappropriate? Yikes.

528,5,A6XR7Y415RPD0,B006KWAKDE,"I enjoyed this story very much. I liked America who really didn't want to win the handsome prince preferring the boy of the lower caste that she has known and loved for years. But he pressures her into signing up by convincing her that he would feel guilty if she let the opportunity pass her by. She is also being pressured by her mother who loves her but wants her to better herself it it is possible. America signs up never believing that she would be one of the thirty-five girls chosen as potential mates for the prince.

Once chosen, she is still determined not to marry the prince. She has a distorted vision of who he is. It isn't until he comes to her rescue when she is having a panic attack that she learns that the prince isn't at all who she thought he was. She still doesn't want to marry him, but she offers to be his friend. Friends are something neither of them have had before.

This was an interesting society where people are born into castes which dictate what sort of job is available to you. America's caste is composed of artists of various kinds. America is a singer and plays lots of instruments. Aspen, her first love, is one caste lower and is in service to anyone who will hire him. None of the lower castes, America's or Aspen's have enough to eat. That is one incentive for America to take part in the Selection, the meals at the palace are far beyond what she can get at home.

Life isn't idyllic at the palace. There is some rivalry between the girls who are competing for the prince though most of them do become friends. There is the requisite mean girl in the story who makes life harder for America than it would have to be. But the main problem is rebels who attack the palace. There are two factions - the North and the South. One faction seems to be searching for something in the palace and the other just seems bent on destruction.

This was a great beginning to a series and I am eager to read more books to find out what happens to America and which boy she chooses. I'm rooting for the prince.",A Romantic Dystopia,6,2017-04-13
529,4,A35K5OVNYUOP52,B006KWAKDE,"""True love is usually the most inconvenient kind.

Im going to start by saying that I had very low expectations for this novel. Previews of it Ive read and descriptions on various book sites didn't do much for me in terms of sparking my interest. However, I have had plans to read the first of this trilogy since the plot had been announced. And while Ill admit right now that the plot and writing were at times weak, it was still a very entertaining read.

(At the same time, I think it had a lot more potential to be something bigger than it was. But I don't want that to take away from the positives of it.)

Im giving off a bit of mixed reviews for this, aren't I? Id like to clarify before we go on that I really did like the story. This novel is solid enough to make me want to read the remainder of the series. Just had to throw that out there!

As stated, my expectations were low when the plot was at first described as The Hunger Games (I mean really, what? In what way is the plot even similar to that? Cmon!) meets The Bachelor  it lacked its appeal for me since Ive never been that interested in reality dating shows. And essentially, that is where the majority of our plot takes place. In the future country of Illa, the current prince must choose his future wife during a competition called The Selection.

And what do you know, we have yet another love triangle. Gag.

Im kidding  Im not bitter about that. See, Im not saying it isn't a tired road in terms of plots in young adult literature and television. Because in all honestly, love triangles are a prominent part of some peoples lives. But it would be nice to see a novel series not be about a love triangle. It would be especially nice if at least one side of this love triangle wasn't something of interest to me. Honestly, I enjoyed our main characters relationships with both Aspen and Prince Maxon.

Now, I could waste time and focus on other flaws I find throughout the novel: like the slow start to it, the rushed points, etc. But Im going to focus on the positives, because in spite of everything: The Selection is a promising start to a new series and is definitely going to cater to the romantic girls out there looking for a new series to begin.

America Singer is likeable in many ways. And though she isn't the strongest lead character Ive come across, she has great promise to grow in the remaining two novels of this series. I, for one, cannot wait to further get to know what makes her tick. And who she chooses. Maybe we can see more of her family, as well  it is very endearing how much she cares for her family, though they may annoy her from time to time. Her bond with her little sister, little brother and father in particular peaked my interest.

As for her mother well, she sort of irks me for the time being. But Im not saying I don't understand where shes coming from, because its easy to understand her character in the brief moments we hear of her.

(I particularly enjoyed her saying she picked herself. Though it won't last, and may not be the endgame of the series, it is always a favorite resolution of mine when it comes to love triangles.)

Im interested to know who Maxon picks, as well. Though America is in a love triangle, Maxon has his pick of so many girls  and he is a teenage boy, after-all. Im looking forward to reading into his mind more and more to get an idea of his feelings further. For his country, for the girls. I have a feeling his character is just getting started and may be a big surprise.

Im intrigued to find out what Marlees hiding. Im interested to see her friendship with America hopefully grow  how cute would a series best friend partnership be between the two?! Oh, don't let me down! Im hoping we learn more about her in the second novel. Everything we can learn about her, actually. And so many of the other girls in the competition. In all honestly, Id also like to see more added to the mean girl of the story, Celeste. Could there be more to her than what meets the eyes? Or is she just as vile as she seems?

And finally, Im pulling for Aspen. This may change, but Ill admit it that while I love Maxon: Ive been rooting for Aspens misguided care for America since the moment we met him. I think they are cute in spite of flaws and I have a soft spot for longtime sweethearts. What can I say? Id like to see things progress for the two again and hope they find a resolution for their problems before their romance slips away.

Maybe Im one of the minority but while Id love to hear much more about the royal family and Maxons relationship with both of his parents, Id really enjoy learning more about the history of their country. More than what we know. More about the rebels and the constant threats.

Now, I know what you may all be thinking  is it really worth the read? Youve read the hype, but cant help but wonder: what is it that this novel is about? Well, its part futuristic coming of age and part young adult romance. Which is hit or miss with most people. I cant say a lot happens throughout the novel, but if you are a fan of romance then this novel is probably for you. It is sweet, short and fun. Check up on it, kiddos.

This book is really a popular one and I had to pick it up as many of my friends read it. Some really enjoyed it and others did not like it at all. One thing I have noticed that most people who did not like it were actually disappointed more about the atmosphere of the book and the era it was set. Their main purpose of reading this book must have been ""to enjoy another dystopian book"". I can't blame them because in that area the book was not very deep to focus on the dystopian times. Actually many times I have been imagining this was set in the classical era of dancing ballrooms etc. Of course mince the jeans and other stuff. Disregarding the era that the story takes place in I have throughly enjoyed reading this book and felt the style of writing is very easy to grasp.

The story even though it is a simple one but written in a beautiful way. A girl (America) loves a guy (Aspen) who is lower than her in class. They break up, the girl enters into a competiton with 35 girls from different classes to marry a prince (Maxon). I liked several characters in the book and would love to know more how they will act in the sequel.

I highly recommend the book for the fans of young adult and romance genres. If you are only looking for a dystopian book then you might be disappointed but still I would say give it a chance.",35 Girls competing for one prince. Who is going to win?,18,2017-03-15
531,2,A1ZV39LB3IJXXY,B006KWAKDE,"I was looking for a quick, easy, light-hearted read... and I found it. The description originally intrigued me and I thought this might be something kind of fun. Unfortunately, this book was lacking in substance with a tired plot that's been overdone so many times that it almost felt like I could predict the next line in the story. The only difference is that some of these overused plots have been merged together... and not very well.

The setting is supposedly somewhat Dystopian, but unlike what we'd seen in Hunger Games or Divergent (books that have loosely been compared to The Selection), there is actually very little description other than rating people a number (1-8). Other than that, the world-building is seriously lacking. There's more of a focus on the actual dresses and the food that's served at the palace, while 35 teenage girls catfight over the prince's attentions. It was reminiscent of a bad reality television show in book form.

I had hope that there might be some redeeming qualities about the book. The heroine of our book came from a lower caste and was able to bring some of her experiences to the palace. Granted, these weren't exactly first-hand experiences... but she ""knew people"" who were lower caste. The relationship between the prince and America (yes, that's our heroine's name), was slow to build. She had left a previous love interest back home and was having a difficult time reconciling her break up with him. All in all, I thought that growing relationship between America and the prince was well done and very sweet.

In fact, I enjoyed their relationship enough that I went ahead and bought the second book. However, I'm going to warn potential readers now before they become engaged in this series --- The ""ex"" makes an appearance in the book and our heroine proceeds to start waffling back and forth between her ""ex"" and the prince, leading both of them on. Now I'm sorry, love triangles may be popular among some readers (I'm even a fan when they're done well)...

But when a love triangle is the simple result of a girl not being able to make a decision and stick to it... or even worse, misleading, betraying or cheating on the person she's leading on... I'm done. Not only am I done, but I'm downright pissed off. I stopped reading the second book at 30% and have labeled it as DNF (Did Not Finish). It irks me that these types of books are being marketed toward young women as though these are desirable traits. In what world is it ever okay to engage in that sort of behavior and disregard concepts such as honesty and integrity? Stringing two men along because you can't make up your freaking mind is not romance people! Sneaking out to meet up with them behind the other's back is not romance! It's wrong!

As such, I do not recommend this series.

532,4,A1HBTW5M7ZZ9PT,B006KWAKDE,"I heard of this book around the time it came out, but I remember it mostly for the drama the author and her agent caused. You see, there was a book reviewer who made comments about this book that the author and the agent didn't like. How did they plan to solve this so-called problem reviewer? Well, they talked (on Twitter & in plain view {get it?}) about ""liking"" the positive reviews, so the negative one could be buried. Well, the reviewer's very well known in YA blogging circles, honestly royalty when it comes to YA blogging ( I love her), so burying her review was impossible. What did the agent decide to do? She decided to call the reviewer a ""b****"". On Twitter. In plain view (love).

Now, this isn't the worst thing in the world, but it definitely made me question the morals of the author and the agent; and, thus, this book. But I suddenly decided I wanted to give it a try.

& I'm really glad I did.

This book was a very fun read for me. I mean, it's nothing like Amy Tintera's Ruined, a book filled with kingdoms and authentic intrigue, but it is interesting enough that I was pulled in from the first page. I would say this book's the perfect combination of literary and commercial; it has enough plot threads to have a deeper meaning, but the writing is so simple that it would fit for any story.

I really enjoyed America, though I felt she should have more self-esteem. Maxon was a stud in the beginning, but by the end he seemed like the guy who was amazing...but was a douche when it counted. Aspen was paper thin to me, but I loved May and America's mom. America's an insane name, like why would the author make the ending of this series so obvious(?), but...yeah, I hate her name.

To summarize: by the end of this ""novel"", the Selection is not finished, America is still in a love triangle between Maxon and Aspen, and the mysterious rebels have not been quelled. Not one plot point is resolved. This book is merely the starting point of a swindle to get more money out of you to finish the story, which in this case is three more novels!

536,4,A1Z7XTVAWQ51W9,B006LS0PTQ,"Where to start?

The good: The plot of a wounded hero and a strong woman separated by miscommunication is not uncommon. The exact cause of the miscommunication, which is cleared up fairly early, is perfect, believable, and unique. I also like some of the other characters. Bedford and Meg are realistically flawed.

Not necessarily good:

I don't think the Bedford subplot added to the story. Its outcome was predictable.

The identity of the murderer also was predictable.

I was frustrated when Sophie and Keene arrived at the dinner party. It had been some time since I'd read the book about them, and I finally had to stop reading this book and go back to The Wedding Duel to know what they were talking about in regard to Algany. I didn't remember the other friends either, but I didn't spend time trying to figure them out. In other words, this section of the book keeps it from standing alone and will confuse anyone who hasn't read the previous one.

568,4,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B006MZH7XU,"This is a different kind of love story.  It is one that will make you think.  The hero is a wealthy businessman in new Zealand.  his young wife has died of breast cancer and has left him with a 2 year old daughter.  His sister-in-law has taken leave from her job to stay with him and help him get back on his feet.  He clearly wants her gone.  Or so it seems.  Lots of times things are not as they appear.  He loved his wife and was faithful to her completely but she is gone and he is hurting.  He has always had feelings for the other woman that looks so like his wife.  he has never acted on his feelings.  He made sure that he was out of town when she visited and he worked hard at keeping those feelings he experienced pressed down.  But now she is in his house, in his thoughts and within easy reach.

Most of the story is about the two of them going through serious bouts of guilt, despair, lust, etc.  They know that even though they never betrayed her sister there is no way the two of them can be together.  Society would never accept it and would think badly of both of them.  Until his wife takes control of the situation.  It was a good story.  Lots of sex so if that is a problem for you, better pass on this one.  it was a thought provoking story and I would definitely advise reading it with an open mind and heart.  A good read.

Just a personal note --  I have a young neighbor that has a story much like this one.  His young wife discovered a lump in her breast right after giving birth. The doctor assured her it was a swollen milk gland and to not worry about it.  About 4-6 months later the area became so painful that she couldn't stand to be touched.  After tests, etc. it was discovered that it was cancer, aggressive, and not much they could do.  I have learned that this age group for women has the highest rate of deaths from breast cancer.  I wonder if a lot don't detect it because it is assumed it is a swollen milk gland.  Anyway, she went through every treatment possible.  Chemo, etc.  Even some experimental drugs were tried.  Nothing worked and she just got sicker and sicker.  Less than 3 years later she had passed.  He said that he loved her and that if the cancer had not been there they would still be married today but that with her so sick she really left him long before she passed.  She did stay at home until the very end.  Her family helped him with her care and he had everything else.  He took care of the baby, worked fulltime, prepared all the meals and did the housework.  I really don't know how he did what he did at such a young age himself.  So this story I just read could have been his in a way.  We just don't know what a surviving spouse goes through emotionally, physically, etc. so it is very unfair for the rest of use to pass judgment on them for what they do or don't do.  I really think the hero in our story loved his wife.  I think he probably lusted after the sister!!  But then I think he did love her at the end.  My friend did eventually marry again.  And, he seems to be happy.

2) Do the characters annoy me? (No -- when they do, a fatal flag in escapist writing genres for me);
3) Does there seem to be good sexual and mental chemistry between the main characters?  (Yes!  The author really conveys a very strong passionately sexual tension and this can be graphic, so be forewarned)

Best of all were the characters, they are amazing.  Gervase and Elizabeth's story kept me glued to the kindle from start to finish.

581,3,A3FU3N6TXJBSRM,B006PYDFTI,"Elizabeth is sent to the Gervase, Duke of Diable Delamare, by her stepfather, she thinks to perform chores for him and he thinks for a night in his bed. She ends up in his household working at decoding cryptic notes detailing an assassination attempt as well as to receive lessons in becoming a courtesan so that she can earn money to support her invalid brother.
While I enjoy Ms. Pearce's work, this one was kind of a mess. You had the dark 'alpha' Duke, the plain bluestocking virgin, a spy caper, the evil gambling stepfather, the first wife who betrayed the Duke, and several other tropes one can find in a Regency romance. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind tropes, but this book seemed to throw them all in without following through to a logical conclusion or giving good backstory to explain whatever was going on. There wasn't much real connection between the hero and heroine, at least in my opinion. He didn't always seem that interested in even forwarding her 'education' at times. I did like Gervase, I just wish he had been developed more. Elizabeth was more of a puzzle.  Sometimes she's very docile and others a bit of a shrew.

When a gambling debt sent her into the household of of Duke of Diable Delamere, the most famous rake in the Kingdom (or perhaps, the continent) she was determined to exploit his skills, to teach her the skills to be a courtesan... So that she can support her invalid brother all but disowned by their family. The Duke, tempted by this strong young women who can think, asked for her help in thwarting an assassination plot against the prince regent by decoding some messages in addition to teaching her about the bedroom skills. As the two are ever drawn closer to each other, they are endangered by the plot that was closer than they ever suspect...

The mystery was intriguing, and the characters had a lot of depth to them. I was trying to solve the mystery and piece together all the small town relationships. I connected with the main characters and liked that they had a colorful history with good and bad points. They had flaws and strong attributes.

The setting and atmosphere was nicely described. And sheesh, do I understand lake effect! I remember the November we had a unbelievable amount of snow.

Full disclosure, I did hit about 40% and feel like my interest had piqued. At that point I was ready for the story to be wrapping up, and clearly I wasn't close. At 50% I skimmed until 80% and picked up there. I still wanted to know how it all played out and whodunit.

I could pinpoint I was tired of Joe, when hear the same rage words over & over. Yes, you explain that, but repeat it so much, that's more than I could take.

PART OF THE REVIEW:
It's one of my constant reminders to authors (Indies, Experience, Big Names, etc) fond of writing books without always use cliffhangers or because the 1st book sold well the 2nd the price higher up. When you see the rest of the books are almost for Free, so: ""BABY STEPS"".

An big seller of ""books"" could do that, had many loyal readers until they decide ""not anymore"", I wrote by experience (my favorite character was leave hanging trying to bring, what I called ""new blood"", to the series, that never ends with a ""cliffhanger"").

What happens, Oh, Damn...""Big Name Author"", wrote the main character as paint on the Wall, almost invisible and the ""new ones"" got the ""mains"". Also, got parts of almost all the series and ""create"", HA HA"", a ""new book"". The End, m many Readers said: ""BYE, Big Author, Not a penny more from Me and the Reviews were Terrible"".

Please, Authors...read the Reviews, your ARC's and beware that could be the End of many Careers.

I'm very honest with my Reviews, not only for me, the author or other readers, how an author know when did something good or need improvement?

How another reader believe in my review? If I didn't read the book, I don't Review. If the book is good, Review. If the book isn't good, Review.

Instead, one simple sentence stating his reason for anger followed by an angry reaction would have been sufficient.

First time I read something by David Adams was in the SF anthology&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Robot-Chronicles-The-Future-Chronicles/dp/B00M3GIBUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Robot Chronicles (The Future Chronicles)</a>&nbsp;and found his short story so good that I wanted to read his first full length novel in the Lacuna series. As some points out this is not a 5-star book, but good enough for me.

Some feedback if David still have time to read feedback.

The staff aboard the star-ship are using hand held com-radios, walkies-talkies, and punches computer keyboards in the year 2035! Already in the 50-ies airplane pilots and tank crews were using headphones and throat mikes. I guess absolutely everything will be voice and eye-controlled by 2035, if not implant controlled. Military reality will be experienced thru a VR-interface, not IRL. This book was published 2012 but NASA used VR already in the 90-ies and US Army in the 80-ies. The Field Commanders in 2035 will be way back and a soldier is walking up to the alien with a full VR on-line.

e-bay will probably be bought by the 3-4 times bigger Alibaba company shortly.

If typos can be fixed, I hope archaic clicking keyboards and crackling walkies-talkies also can be replaced. It disturbs me more than typos and black-box technology ;)

P.S. The space-ship's rail-gun is truly awesome. The bullet weighting 6kg with a speed of 30,000km/sec has a kinetic energy of 4 times the 16 Kilotonne A-bomb over Hiroshima. Top rail gun designs currently [2003] can launch a 2kg projectile with a muzzle velocity of close to 4km/s on roughly 6 meter rails. To reach this kind of velocity (4km/s), the power source must provide roughly 6.5 million Amps. Multiply several 1000 times to attain 30,000km/s. Ouch.

Hard also to believe Beijing's rail-gun could have hit the alien spaceship at L4 or L5 with several bullets, the L4 and L5 are rather large volumes of space (more than several 1,000 times bigger than Jupiter itself) containing millions of asteroids and rocks. The crew would have little idea where inside this astronomical volume of space the ship would care to stop before space jumping.

P.P.S. After reading 50% I have to quit. Too little science, mostly fiction. Lagrange ""points"" are not points, but vast volumes of space, like zones. They are thousands of times bigger than Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Earth etc Each planet have their own Lagrange zones relative to the sun and each other and their moons. See image at https://i.stack.imgur.com/om9i5.png for getting the size of Jupiter's L4 and L5. The green clouds are Lagrange ""points"" and the little red dot is Jupiter.

Throwing nukes in these titanic zones, to hit and destroy a space-ship is like throwing a few grams of burning magnesium in the Pacific ocean, hoping to hit and kill a specific shrimp at 1,000 ft depth. Except it's more difficult.

Then Newton comes along and spoils the rail-gun. ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" The Beijing star-ship would have been thrown backwards with equal force, that is 65 Kilotonne of TNT for each shot. The g-forces involved would be astronomical. Accelerating nukes on a 500 meter rail to 30,000 km/s would make the detonator and the uranium (or californium etc) totally fuse into a slug  never to explode. Maybe the author doesn't know this.

Here is a photo of a rail-gun used in US Navy for experimental purpose. https://goo.gl/8Q5BJe The bullets can reach a speed of 3 km/s. Look at the cabling!

The rail-gun on Beijing needs 100,000+ times more power for every shot fired, than the US Navy's current gun. The slug would be accelerating on the rail-gun for 1/10,000 of a sec, then it would be in free fall, no more acceleration, the gun has way too short barrel. But suppose the rail-gun was long enough (like 10,000 times longer), the energy it takes to accelerate one shot is like a 65 kilotonne nuclear bomb. Not even Superman, Harry Potter and Gandalf can do that together.

It's like a story where the hero shoots down jet-fighters with his .38 service gun and then sinks a supercarrier with an M60 machine gun. If you don't know what a gun is then the story will work just fine, else not.

Little science, mostly scientism involved (scientism is language that is using scientific words to appear like science).

There are many holes - like humans going from terrestrial to having a lunar base, three space-faring battleships, and crews fully trained in the intricacies of space warfare in just 8 years - that I could overlook (somewhat) to move the narrative forward. The action sequences were interesting and made the book hard to put down, but the story dragged through way too much sex & relationship drama for my tastes... especially for a sci-fi novel!",Some decent sci-fi...,2,2017-02-02
629,2,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B006RZNR3Y,"I admit, I'm a sucker for a good science fiction story.  And while ""hard"" sci-fi stories that stick as close to scientific fact as they can, such as ""The Martian"" and ""Saturn Run,"" are enjoyable in their own right, sometimes I just freaking enjoy the implausible space opera type that ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" have made popular.  And it's always interesting to see how different authors pull off a First Contact story, as there are many different ways a first encounter with extraterrestrial life can go.  So I started Lacuna with... not exactly sky-high hopes, but with the expectation to find an entertaining story.

Sadly, ""Lacuna's"" flaws outnumber its strengths to such a degree that, while I can't count it as among the worst sci-fi books I've ever read, nor can I recommend it.  It starts out with some promise, but soon degenerates into a mess.

""Lacuna"" follows the story of Melissa Liao, an officer in the Chinese military who counts herself as one of the survivors of a devastating alien attack on Beijing... an attack that takes fifty million lives.  Identical attacks take place in Tehran, Iran and in Sydney, Australia, and all are accompanied by the same cryptic message -- ""never again attempt to develop this kind of technology.""  Humanity's response is not to acquiesce to the aliens, but to build three huge military ships to fight back... and Melissa finds herself helming one of them.  With the aid of James Gregoire, the handsome Belgian captain of another starship, and Summer Rowe, a hyperactive and foul-mouthed computer nerd, Melissa sets out to defend Earth from the alien onslaught... but when she finally comes face to face with the enemy, she finds they have far more in common than they realized, and that the aliens have devastating plans for humanity...

The writing of this book is... okay.  It's not terrible, but neither is it very good.  It reads in a workmanlike manner, serviceable but not particularly memorable.  I didn't find any major spelling or grammar errors, or at least none severe enough to jar me out of reading.  The author does really seem to like the F-word, however, and while I can put up with it in moderation (I love ""The Martian"" and ""That Bear Ate My Pants"" despite both authors using the F-word periodically), but here it's used so often that it ceases to even be shocking, which is a problem in my book.

The characters are, quite frankly, either very bland or thoroughly unlikable.  I can put up with unlikable characters in fiction when it serves the purpose of the story, but when we're expected to cheer for or identify with said unlikable character, it gets tiresome.  Melissa is, to put it politely, a witch, and while I understand a military officer can't exactly be soft and friendly, it seemed the harsh and angry side of her was all there was.  (On a minor note, the story about how she came to have a more Western name despite being born and raised in China comes across as forced and unbelievable.)  Gregoire, the obvious love interest, is an utterly-bland character who feels like he stepped out of the pages of a Harlequin romance novel, and Summer... the author was probably trying to appeal to his nerd readers with her, but I wanted to slap her.  She was obnoxious, foul-mouthed, utterly disrespectful (I can't believe she could get away with most of her behavior aboard a military vessel, even as a civilian), and constantly wedging references to ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" and the ""XKCD"" webcomic (!) into her conversation at every opportunity.  It was as if the author was beating the reader over the head with this character, going ""See, she's a geek, love her!""  Sorry, it takes more than nerd quotes to win this nerd over.  (For the record, not even the most hardcore nerds are going to put ""Han Shot First"" on their tombstone, and quite frankly, that joke was old a decade ago.)

The plot might have saved the book, but what could have been an interesting exploration of human/alien interaction soon becomes a generic ""Earth vs. Aliens"" plot.  At first the novel seems like it will be more complex than just ""evil aliens out to destroy us,"" with the aliens having a legitimately good reason for wanting humanity to stop developing a certain type of technology (though the way the story is presented, our technological development is apparently more important than avoiding the destruction of the universe).  But it doesn't take long for the aliens to simply want to wipe out humanity just to be evil -- the aliens even gloat about shedding human blood and torturing Melissa for kicks.  And while we do see at least one sympathetic alien, I find it hard to believe that said sympathetic alien would betray her kind so easily for humanity's sake, and feel no remorse for doing so.  Every other alien that shows up is either cannon fodder or a cackling '80s cartoon villain.

SPOILER ALERT:  Also regarding the aliens -- while the scientists maintain their biology is ""like nothing I've ever seen,"" said aliens are essentially just cat people.  I'm not even joking, they're literally described as cat people.  I'm not asking for ""gray aliens"" or for something completely bizarre, but it's just hard to take the aliens at all seriously when they're literally just humanoid cats.

I don't think this book deserves one star, as I think the author has a lot of potential and some fascinating ideas, and while his prose was fairly bland, he at least knows his technical writing skills and the writing didn't make my eyes bleed.  But all the same, the story feels like a mess, and I can't bring myself to keep reading the series or to recommend it to anyone else.  Better luck next time, Mr. Adams...","Promising First Contact story becomes generic ""evil aliens"" plot",3,2016-07-20
630,3,A1FIRSBLE8NZIF,B006RZNR3Y,"Without warning, Earth  is attacked by an alien species. They destroy three cities, leave a garbled message, and then leave.

Fast forward a few years and Earth has completed building three new  ships on the moon, ships designed to take the fight to their enemy should they come back. The Shangai is captained by Melissa Liao and during trials out near Saturn, the enemy returns. Captain Liao decides to confront them and in the process, destroys the enemy ship and captures one of the aliens alive.

The writing is fine and decently paced. Overall I liked the idea of the story but it's the execution I have a problem with. Captain Liao is utterly unlikable. I don't mean that in the way you don't like the bad guy because it's the bad guy, I mean there's nothing likable about this character.

You've also got to deal with a scientist/engineer who curses every other sentence for no reason whatsoever and seemingly has no regard for advanced technology. In one scene, she demonstrates an alien sidearm by shooting the bulkhead, causing it to melt, then she casually tosses the weapon aside. It's not believable.

The there's a pissing match between a petty, jealous former executive officer who, somehow commits mutiny in an attempt to commandeer two ships. Now, everybody on board these two ships knows there is a captured alien, but somehow nobody knows that this officer was relived of duty and sent to the brig.

'14' colonies are mentioned instead of 13, and the time sense is messed up a couple of times. Although taking place in the period 1814-16 (and on), there seems to be confusion that British soldiers are still present in the colonies. Also, the almost 200 year ago period is sometimes presented as being much longer ago. Finally, 'poured over' a map should be 'pored over'.

642,3,A396UH172DTU4P,B006WB4W2I,"This is the real life story of American POW told largely in his his own words through his letters home. The narrator steps in between the letters to provide continuity and context.  This approach could work, but the narrator is too intrusive, and her tone is annoying.

For instance, she says, ""This, dear reader, is what Don describes of his experience as a prisoner at Stalag VIIA."". That is patronizing.  We already know what he described because we just read it in his letter.  Besides that, the whole ""dear reader"" thing is annoying and steps all over the story.  It is a narrative style from the 1800s, and it should stay there.

Not content to merely narrate, she feels compelled to preach.  ""Thus imagine yourself at Stalag VIIA in March 1945.""  She needs to just tell the story, and allow us to experience it on our own.

Then there are omitted words, extraneous words, run on sentences, and sentence fragments.  Awkward sentences abound.  ""They could not sit up in their bunks, and very poor lighting.""  That doesn't work, but it is typical.  Here is another one.  ""Because it was so cold and little food and space, basically the men stayed in bed most of the time.""

It is great that this story has been preserved for the world and for Don's family.  I can tell this was a labor of love.  However, it needs a good editor who is a native English speaker to make it a stronger, more coherent story.","Interesting enough, but....",2,2016-10-28

But if you give it a chance, what a story! It puts other Man vs Nature stories to shame. Hemingway puts you in the boat with this old man, and watch his fortunes rise and fall, and how he copes with physical and mental pain, alone and far from shore.

648,5,A2YXRT2XIJIO57,B006YGE4NS,"Ive read the majority of Hemingways works, almost all of them when I was in my teens and 20s. I am now in the process of re-reading a number of them, including this finely crafted novella, which was a contributing factor in Hemingway being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Particularly this work, after almost a half a century, resonate all the more, now that you can feel some of the old mans pains, and you are much more conscious how you have to use your knowledge and experience to overcome the declining strength of ones body. A high school student really cannot truly understand.

The old man is Cuban, whose wife has died, and he lives in a shack, alone, along the beach, still practicing the only real profession he has ever known: being a fisherman. A young boy has adopted him, and provides moral and physical support to alleviate his poverty.  The old man has had his glory days, sailing as far away as Africa, where he saw the lions on the beach. He also had immense strength in his youth, beating an opponent in a hand-wrestling contest that lasted all night.

The heart of the novella is when the Old Man grabbed the Brass Ring, hooking the largest fish ever, a marlin that is two feet longer that his 16 foot skiff. It is truly an epic struggle to reel the marlin in  and the old man fishing experience allows him to think like a fish, knowing instinctively the most likely tactics the fish will use. The old man also instinctively knows  long before the days of GPS and weather forecasts, where he is, and what weather will be forthcoming. Even with all his experience, he rues how unprepared he is, in terms of the omission of certain equipment from his boat, for such a multi-day struggle with The Big One of his life. He can still summon forth some of his youths strength, along with his cunning, in order to prevail.

Victory though is bittersweet, as it so often is. On more than one occasion Ive thought that the bleak outcome of this work might have foreshadowed Hemingways decision to commit suicide, at the young age of 61, when so many possibilities still remained.

In terms of high school assignment books, this is one that I fully advocate still being assigned, for many a student should appreciate the straightforward narrative, and the clean-cut epic struggle, even though today they might never have heard of Joe DiMaggio, or known that the Dodgers were once in Brooklyn. But if you read it in high school today, please make a modest commitment to read it a half century later, and undertake the steps to improve your chances of making it that half century. For your understanding of it, the second time around, might easily be 3 x that of your youth. 5-stars.",A late in life struggle,29,2016-05-13

If it has a significantly high rating, then I read the full description and am hooked.  Always remain open and you may stumble upon a great plot, incredible twists & turns and unforgettable characters. That's what happened with ""A Renegade's Embrace"".

I loved this story, it was a lot of feelings and every character had issues that gripped your heart and squeezed it.

The writing style is good with lots of dialogues but also some internal dialogues that made the story even sweeter. I loved when Shane really reflected on a friends problem and came to a conclusion that seemed rather good and mature.

The relationship between Shane and Trey grows slowly(don't tell me you didn't understand there would be a relationship, it's not a spoiler) and I thought it was sweet in the build up.

668,4,A3PZJIKCYWM85W,B0070FDJPG,"I gave this book 3.5 stars but rounded up since Amazon doesn't do half stars....yet.

First off, I didn't get the Enemies to Lovers theme.  They were never enemies, if anything they were just avoiding of each other.  Just because he gave him a wedgie one time years ago doesnt make them enemies. It just makes Trey a bit of a dick.

The major them of this book seemed to be forgiveness.  I enjoyed it.  I could have done without so much detailed sex.  I know right, I never say that. I get it they are experimenting, but I don't need a play by play for every single time.  Mix it up a bit, throw in a fade to black scene, variety is the spice of life and all that jazz.

Trey was just the cutest, shyest guy.  He tried to fight his attraction, but in the end finally gave in to his feelings.  Shane didn't seem to know what to do about his growing feelings and he was rightly conflicted when it came to acting on them.

I thoroughly enjoyed the toothpaste scene. It was so funny and something I have done with my husband. And the scene when June and Shane had an honest talk about their father and their relationship with Trey.  It was very realistic and emotional for me.

It didn't seem that there was a real climax either.  More like a bunch of little ones. Bottom line, the book was decent, will I read the rest in the series, Mmmmm probably not till next year at least.",It was decent.,2,2016-03-07

670,1,A16WBOMWK2GERJ,B0070DZI70,"First of all, I DNF.  I think this is the first book that I haven't finished (Possibly 2nd).  I usually try to finish a book, no matter what.  I just couldn't this time.  I made it 65% of the way, and just couldn't go on.  I'm sorry to the author, I appreciate that you released it for free, I appreciate that it takes bravery to release your work to the public, but I just really hated this book.  The premise of the book wasn't bad, but the execution was terrible... to the point that it seemed naive and almost like it was written as a high school project by someone who had very little (or no) experience with dating or romance.

The h was irritating, weak, and whiny.  Both H's had traits that made them unlikable.  One breaks up with her after 4 years for basically no reason (& starts dating anther woman a month after, but claims to love her deeply), the other throws tantrums and hissy fits (or completely ignores her) when things don't go his way.  I can't imagine why any woman would want either of them.

Characters were boring and one dimensional.  All of the characters seemed like they were the same person, it didn't matter if they were male or female, they all had the same irritating and boring personality and all of them spoke in a formal manner that made it completely unrealistic.  Writing can and should be formal, EXCEPT when displaying speech on the characters parts.  No one speaks formally like that, let alone eeeveryone in the entire book.

The relationship between the h&H was way too 'over the top' and the h's relationship with  the H's family was even more so 'over the top'.  Everyone got alone perfectly, loved each other instantly, and behaved as though they were family and best friends immediately upon meeting one another.  Very unrealistic.

I just couldn't go on reading, I was bored, and more importantly, I didn't give a *&^% what happened to any of the characters or the story, definitely not enough to continue torturing myself with reading this.

I liked that we were able to see the impact of Karl's bullying from the first book, on both characters, in this one.  I also loved that Paul struggled with his sexuality because of his experiences being an outcast due to his stutter and never wanting to feel that again.  Additionally, Paul's marriage wasn't explained away as a lie, but rather, as a sincere effort to love a woman that he truly cared for.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin.

Where to begin, though?
One, if you are wanting a story that just promises sexual tension and sex, shifter sex, well, you have come to the right place, because this novella is laced with it all. It instantly starts off with Lily and Kieran having an intense sexual tension stare off and then abrupt halt once they get to ""talkin"" by her friend/pack mate Sara. Then there's some rogue issues and that ultimately didn't go nowhere. I guess the author wanted to show that Lily is getting her Guardian mojo back, that led to utter disappointment, because really nothing got resolved. At the end of the novella, I was left wondering, ""When are we going to get back to that? Am I going to have to buy the next installment to find out?"" I don't like when I'm teased with something and there is no follow through making me guess if it's going to happen in the next installment. It pretty much a way to trap me in to wanting to get the next installment. I don't play that. No'mam. Essentially, it was about a one night stand that could lead to more more. If that is what you are looking for then be my guest. Yep. That's all I can say about this novella.",The Long and Short of It: Shifter Sex/Sexual Tension,3,2016-07-06

678,5,A3TBDNLHKQM65W,B0071DLTTK,"I stumbled upon the '1800 Club' series via the onscreen list that appears (scroll down from your current selection) titled 'Inspired by your Browsing History.'  That algorithm works pretty good sometimes.

I've read Book 1, then subsequently 2 & 3.  I'm just about to start Book 4 and I must say, I'm enjoying this series very much. Yes - it can be a bit nave or adolescent at times. Yes - it's not exactly what you would call gritty. Yes - it certainly isn't 'hard' Sci-Fi. Yes - there are some inaccuracies and logic holes here and there. Yes - I'm wondering if the author must've been on a diet and trying to cut back on his drinking and smoking when writing these, because the characters are always tucking in to great dinners and then relaxing with old brandy and fine cigars.

But you know what? It just doesn't matter! These are extremely entertaining. If you're a Time Travel junkie, as I am, then let go of some of your perhaps ingrained preconceptions and just go with the flow. They're really a lot of fun.

And (maybe the best recommendation I could give)... I'd sure like to be one of those guys.

Update to review:

I'm currently up to Book 10. These are quick, easy reads. Ive enjoyed them very much. The authors penchant for describing in great detail his characters period-correct clothing and for reciting the entire (!) menu presented at any of the meals they partake of is, indeed, of great interest - for a while. Its the details that help the reader follow along with the characters wonder and excitement at actually being able to experience the very time periods in which they feel so attracted to.

Perhaps the charm of the series is wearing thin, but Im beginning to get a little fed up with the sameness of the stories. I totally understand if the author chooses to not start mutating the books into strange directions, just because he might feel pressured to. He may well like them just the way they are and doesnt feel the need to shake things up! But, yes, I would like just a smidgeon more intricacy",Great fun for TT junkies,2,2017-03-08

680,1,A1ZVB7606XYYGQ,B0071OU90O,"The writing is well done but the political bias is too much to take. With Kindle unlimited I read a lot of books. I like SciFi and love a series. And writing is a lot of work. But having a well educated and diverse group of reviewers is essential. What made this unreadable by the half-way mark for me is the projection of American right-wing political mythology onto other countries' peoples. When the world needs to pull together there will be some shortages and some nut cases working their crazy conspiracy theories. But economics isn't a zero sum game. Having to build a response to aliens showing up on Mars doesn't mean that doctors and nurses will stop doing their jobs. And Switzerland's Nat'l Healthcare is modeled after Germany's. Everyone has to buy private insurance, insurance companies have to insure anyone who asks, insurance companies can't gouge customers, and pharmaceutical companies can't charge higher prices than in other developed countries like they do with consumers in the U.S.  France also isn't going to stop providing national healthcare because they have agreed to support the war effort. Especially when it is just beginning with construction of the first Frigate in what is to be 3 carriers with a couple of frigates and cruisers each. Nor is the language of Quebec so offensive in France that it would eclipse the dialectic differences within different French-speaking regions in the area, especially when immigrants living in France are included.

Building a fleet would entail spending but also jobs, purchasing materials, shipping, etc. With a worldwide effort likely more people would have jobs and be working harder at them. Not the right-wing mythology that any little stress and EU economies would fall apart because they care for their citizens better than crony capitalism does in the US and 3rd world countries. Really, Swiss Insurers are going to stop paying for necessary eye surgery or the surgeons are going to stop working because the Swiss agree to pay their share based on GDP of protecting the world? Or France will be forced to drop national healthcare causing riots for the same reason? Thus requiring the UN to intercede in France using Swiss and Canadian troops? Who shoot unarmed civilians provoking anti-UN conspirators in the US?

In fact I would have given it 5 stars, it got 4 not in anyway related to the quality of the writing, character development, world-building or any other part of the creation of the book.  I gave it 4 stars simply because the author did not manage to kill a few of the characters whom in my humble opinion needed to be killed like 2 pages after they were introduced.  I plan to read the rest of this series; because the author has me hooked, I absolutely have to know what happens next to Lt. Black, Starr and the rest.  My hope is that Capt. Dickerson (aptly named) gets captured, and then tortured slowly (and I mean extremely slowly) and painfully to death.  He already deserves such just from his actions in this first book.  If he continues to act the same way in the next...  then he needs to be captured on page one and held and tortured till dying at the end of the book.  I can honestly say I don't think I have ever truly hated a character in any book I have read.  But it has finally happened, his behaviour makes me see red.  The author is very good at conveying the pain that the Captain inflicts on others, so well that it is a case of reading about it I feel it.  This is not a comfortable thing, though very much a necessary thing.  The characters in this book very quickly became very real people to me especially Black and Starr.  The story was multi-layers as was the world it is set in.

683,1,A2FZ2I2TZJM1NJ,B007232VP0,"A warning for people who don't want to read certain things.  This series contains rape scenes and/or sexual manipulation (rape).  Just giving you a heads up.

I want to first let it be known that I really like this author.  I also really liked this book!  Here is why I really hate this book without giving any spoilers.  This author has created a world with psypaths and in this world, the ""normal"" people want to essentially get rid of them.  Its a world of normals against psypaths.  She introduces Black (one of the main characters) and he is made out to be a good leader, fearless, and without giving too much information, a great tactician, and very powerful in his own right.  Yet, the author allows this individual to be gullible, bullied, and the most manipulated person ever.  Its a contradiction that becomes more apparent as the books go along.  So far there are 9 of them.  I'm currently reading number 8.  It's so bad what Black will allow people to do to him that its CRAZY!  (When I say ""allow"", trust me, Black has to let people do it for them to do it!)  It's all in the name of keeping ""loved ones safe"" but its getting ridiculous.  One person is manipulating him one way for one reason with a particular threat and another person is coming in another way with another and very different threat, but the latter wants him to endanger the love of his life in exchange for endangering others.  Can books have a limit to how many bad guys there are because this book is reaching the limit...here is all of the people who are either bad guys and/or manipulating Black by book 8.

1.  Silent city (trying to manipulate)
2.  Captain Dickerson (manipulate by threatening everyone and everything.  If it were up to him, he would burn the city down and everyone in it to keep Black on a puppet string and Black is letting him.  The amazing part is his wife doesn't see this blantant characteristic in him and thinks he's fine.  She loves Black like a mother but doesn't see anything.  And just to let you know how depraved Captain Dick is, in book 8 without going into detail, he takes control of Black's mind and forces him to suck multiple men off and kill a fellow officer just to show how he can control Black.  And before this happens, Black is standing around letting them do this WHEN HE IS CAPABLE TO GET OUT.
3.  Lieutenant of BC1 (he is just out for himself)
4.  Lieutenant Kard (the current manipulator who is threatening Black's love of his life and threatening everyone else.  He is threatening to make Black go and blow up psypaths homes with them in it and I'm sure Black is going to remain the puppet to go along and do it!  All in the name of protecting his loved ones!)
5.  Genisus (just a bad guy but you have to try to figure out if he is wanting to kill Black or gain him as a lover.  It develops in other books and yet another instance where the author isn't consistent.  Sometimes he wants to destroy Black, sometimes he wants to rule the city with Black.  It goes back and forth)
6.  JC1 (They are in competition with JC2 and they hate JC2.  It's surprising that you would see this in a police force.  No, they aren't in actual competition but they aren't on the same team.  They hate JC2 and Black is JC2 so they want Black to fail.)

Do you see my point?  There are so many individuals who are perfectly fine to go and kill and/or blow up peoples homes and most are on the police force and expect to not get caught.  It can be only one of these reasons:  1) the police force really really suck and don't actually do their jobs, 2) they are just bluffing which just makes Black once more gullible and lets people manipulate him.

Like I said, I'm currently reading book 8.  These books are like a soap opera.  They seem to have a lot happening, but you get to the end of the book and find that not much has happened.  Bad guy still isn't caught and they have another cliff hanger that takes you into another book.  In all of the eight books, there hasn't been a single bad guy caught and taken care of and the good guys are all having terrible things happen to them.

The reason I really really hate these books???  Even though they are driving me crazy and I'm really pissed off with the author and the direction the books are going, I can't seem to stop.  I want to, but I'm now invested.  I would tell you they are well written, but the author needs to work on plots and character development.  After I finish 8 and 9 I'm going to stop following the author and I won't look for future books.  (I have unlimited reading through Amazon and these books are on the list.  It's the only reason I'm still reading them since I don't have to buy them.  If I had to buy them, I would've stopped a LONG time ago.)  I'm not the only one who feels this way.

In Short: This book is a quick fun read that I think children will really enjoy reading. It also makes a good bedtime story for younger kids. At only 20 pages it a very fast read and a good length to entertain. For anyone of any age who likes fairy tales and a good short story this is a great book to pick up, for free!

Pros: This book is very fun and enjoyable to read. I laughed out loud when reading the note Grandma left for Red. I think both parents and children will enjoy reading this book together. I loved all the characters, the heroes and the villains alike. I actually grew quite attached to the wolves and was a little disappointed that their elaborate scam wasn't paying off in the end! This book even though it is so short it manages some great morals for children. It teaches that crime doesn't pay, don't talk to strangers, don't steal and don't scam people!

Cons: I have no issues with this book.

The two main characters might well be geriatric versions of Stephanie Plum and her sidekick, Lulu.  The book was basically well-written with only a few of the tiniest errors in grammar and punctuation--nothing to really detract from the story itself.  A pleasant way to spend a few hours in light reading.  However, I hope future editions will clean up the terrible mess of Kindle formatting errors.  It's nice that the author knows how to use a hyphen (so many don't), but in the first three chapters alone I counted 16 hyphens that were replaced by an odd little question mark in a box.

695,4,A9UG81EGN9XAR,B0077EOE2C,"I have read all eight books (so far) in the series.

The good points: The author has a great story well suited to serialisation, and keeps the interest up.  The author also has a particular political outlook, but does not propagandise. It is plausible within the world that has been created. This is a very hard thing to do, and very few actually succeed, so well done.  It also has a great range of characters.

The bad: Since there are eight books, there's a lot of back story going on.  As mentioned above, much of the story revolves around a particular political point of view. Repeating that is a negative, since it is understandable and plausible (even if the philosophy isn't mine, I can still see it as feasible in his world) from book 1, having it repeated so that readers who haven't read all the stories can 'get it' just makes me page flick.

698,5,AU5MPGZYJL31G,B0078S9B6G,"This book takes a few pages to ease into, but once you do...you're hooked. This is a fish out of water story of a young man who travels back in time almost sixty years and adapts to a new life. It also a love story, and a very sweet and romantic one at that, told against the back drop of America's entry into WW II.

This is my second Heldt book, the first being the Journey and the time travel theme is a recurring one. Heldt handles it very well and you never feel you've stumbled into a scifi fantasy. Rather, it is a character driven tale following young Joel- the time traveler, as he begins to establish himself in this new era.

He falls in love with a girl who is engaged to be married and another example of Heldt's skill is the handling of the attraction between the new lovers and pain their relationship will cause her fiance, a young soldier about to leave for the war. Heldt manages to avoid a lot of cliches here and this is a highlight of the book.

A comment on characterization. The characters walk off the page very easily- meaning you can identify with them when you were at that point in your life. The strength of this aspect of the book is that you continue to think about them after you've finished their story. Something that writers rarely accomplish.

I've used the word 'sweet' to describe this tale. Let me elaborate a bit so you won't run for the exit. This book approaches love from an idealistic vantage point, perhaps somewhat representing mid-twentieth century values, but in a way where people don't just jump into bed for physical fulfillment. That's what i mean. So there aren't any graphic sex scenes depicted. Relationships are explored and evaluated for long term potential before taking a carnal step. Sweet may not be the word, but it's what occurred to me.

Mostly a linear tale with a couple of neat twists at the end as Joel has to decide whether to continue his new life in the past or return to his present when the opportunity suddenly comes along.

Finally, I want to say the ending is handled masterfully and is very satisfying to the romantically inclined reader. Major congrats to Heldt for avoiding cliches here.

All in all, a very readable and sweet tale of young love. You really can't do better than this one. I bought the next book in this series immediately upon finishing this one. No higher praise can be tendered.",A sweet tale of young love with a time travel hook,2,2017-09-12

I could barely see through the tears reading the last two pages - and the final twist I did NOT see coming.  This book is brilliantly written!  I must say that it wasn't anything like I had pictured. I downloaded the book for free because one of the keywords was WWII and I love WWII romances.  It starts out a little rough, in the present (or at least in the year 2000), but hang on until he goes back. The trip is well worth it. Many times it gave me the feel of one of my fav movies, Casablanca.  I loved Joel by the third chapter and loved him throughout, but I felt toward him as a brother, lol. It was like I was watching my brother find the love of his life, lol.  That's a good thing. ;)  At first, the book showcases four different college age girls and I couldn't figure out which one he would fall for.  Once his grandmother was singled out, that left the other three and for a while, the author keeps us in suspense. Then we realize who Joel loves, but what in the world would happen next, I hadn't a clue.  The book kept me guessing throughout.  I was afraid it would be a copy of Back to the Future, you know, silly and ridiculous, but it's not. Oh, it has funny moments and clever dialogue, but the fact that Joel is experiencing life in 1941 matures him in a way nothing else could. It also was a wonderful look at the differences and yet similarities to life then vs. now. In many ways, this is a beautiful book, with a solid character story and plot.  It's well worth your time.

 If you're looking for a love story, it truly is one, although from the cover I couldn't tell and I let it languish on my kindle for 3 months before I took the plunge.  That would be my only complaint. I wish the cover reflected more of what happens rather than just his stumbling upon the temporary doorway to the past.  There's no sex but there are a few instances of profanity, so I can't say it's a clean romance, but it's close.

700,5,A1KTI9YNBYR1TU,B0078S9B6G,"Have you ever finished a book and just had to sit there in silence for a few moments and just soak it all in? The beautiful writing, the passionate romance, and the gut wrenching decisions the characters made? That is how I felt when I finished The Mine. I put down my kindle and just sat there for a few minutes. I had to soak it all in. I was so sad that it was over, but so happy to have experienced the story.

Joel started out as somewhat of a typical frat guy. He has a kind-of girlfriend and has spent his college career enjoying himself, along with earning a degree in geology. The experiences he has in 1941 shape him into an adult, rather than a college kid. When Joel arrives in 1941, he has to fend for himself and find a way to survive when he has nothing except a couple of quarters. He uses his wits to get himself from Helena, Montana to Seattle, Washington. Once in Seattle, he makes friends with Tom and through Tom he becomes friends with a group of girls, including his future grandmother, Ginny. Joel finds a job and living arrangements and a new family in 1941.

The historical aspects of this novel are so interesting. Joel travelled to May, 1941, just a few short months before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entering World War II. Joel knows what is coming, including the fate of his new friend, Tom, but he cant tell anyone. No one would believe him even if he did tell someone. But its a struggle to let fate take its course. The 1940s world that John Heldt weaves is so clear, I felt like I time travelled along with Joel. I particularly love when the characters go to see Citizen Kane in its first run.

Above all the other aspects of this novel, however, the love story is by far the best part. I am a sucker for a good love story and this one was so sweet without being cheesy. Joel and Grace are so good together and really bring out the best qualities in each other.

Everything else that I want to say about this novel contains more spoilers than I want to give, so I will just leave it with this: read this book. If you enjoy historical fiction and romance with just a splash of science fiction, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. I cant wait to read the next installment in the Northwest Passage series!

702,5,A345U10UP0S8LR,B0078S9B6G,"I am a bit of a sucker for the fantasy of time-travel tales. It is interesting to see the different time vortexes (eg jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, using a special watch, and walking down special steps at the right time etc.), the different reactions to moving to another time period and the problems of whether to return home (if they can), and should they do things that might affect the course of history. With THE MINE John Heldt has started off a series of time-travel tales that are well written, and cleverly plotted to make the most of this fantasy genre.

In 2000 Joel Smith is a confident and adventurous college senior with no worries in the world. One day during a trip to Montana he sees a TV news item about a very rare significant planetary conjunction.  Soon after, following his keen interest in geology he breaks into a boarded-up abandoned mine, passes through a glowing passageway and when he comes out he finds himself in mid-1941, a time only a few months away from Pearl Harbour in days of swing music and a peacetime draft in anticipation of war.

After the initial shock of finding himself in the past, Joel quickly finds his way back to his hometown of Seattle by jumping a freight train. Down on his luck with no money, hungry and tired he helps an apparently rich young man, Tom, from being mugged. Tom takes him home and lets him live in a trailer in the garden. He also introduces him to his girlfriend Ginnie a lovely free-spirited young girl of 21. How would you react to meeting your beloved Grandmother in her youth?

Joel slowly settles down to life in the 1940's, becomes a star salesman in Tom's father's furniture store and makes a lot of money carefully betting on sporting events where he knows the outcome. He makes many friends, especially among Ginnie's circle of beautiful independent-minded young females. Then Joel meets Grace..... But then Pearl Harbour is just around the corner and the rare confluence of planets is about to happen again that may give him a chance to go back to where he belongs.

John Heldt is a great storyteller and seems to have had a lot of fun putting together a bunch of great characters in an unusual setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this fairly short, well-written, entertaining tale with frequently tender (but not explicit) relationships.

There WAS stuff I liked about this book, but ultimately I think it's suffered from improper billing, both public and artistic. I first heard of this book as a kind of meta-narrative, of Star Trek redshirts figuring out their expendable nature and trying to change their narrative around that. And yes, the book works on that level, to an extent, but just when I grew weary of the codas at the end, and the last few chapters in general, Scalzi pulled a fast one and made this book ultimately about choice and fate, something almost Pirandello-like, though a good majority of the book seems to put aside such considerations for a lot of expositional dialogue and occasional wit, which is what wore me down in the first place.

But when I signed up for World Without Ends 12 Awards in 12 Months Reading Challenge, I tried the free first 4 chapters and liked it enough to get the book.  So glad that I did.

The complete quote mentioned above (from the books acknowledgements) is: readers whoassured me that the thing was something more than just a piss-take on televised science fiction (although obviously it is that too). This is absolutely accurate.  Yes the central novel does have an interesting- and often hilarious- take on all of those doomed Star Trek crewmen from their point of view.  But it is also old fashioned sci fi with alternate universes and questions of reality.  The reference to codas in the title is a little misleading.  It is much closer to a novel with three short stories with the three stories focusing on minor characters from the novel covering topics from writers block to the choices we make in life. I enjoyed them at least as much as the core novel.

712,5,A2XPDUGXNGGRAI,B0079XPUOW,"Another humor-sci-fi hit out-of-the-ballpark by John Scalzi; he certainly is a master of this genre.

So what would happen if the Redshirts in the typical television quest sci-fi show were self-aware enough of the danger? How would a group of scientists and explorers overcome the issue of being a ""Redshirt""? Investigate and resolve.

Story got a little too Meta in chapter 23 and the final bit with the end of chapter 23 and start of 24 fell flat to me.

The first time I read the Three Codas - where we return to ""modern"" times and follow the lives of the people impacted by the Redshirts time travel visit was a struggle. I disliked the staggered ending. When I re-read it now, I actually enjoyed the three Codas - first off for giving us more about the people impacted by the visit. Second for the writing exercise the Codas represent - the first Coda is written in first person, the second Coda is written in second person and the third in third person. If someone is having problems with POV definition, reading these three Codas might help. I don't think it will help them write in the different POV, but it will help them understand what they are - the ""I"", ""you"" and ""s/he"".

In conclusion, funny, funny story for the most post. The ending, starting about chapter 21, in the first read-thru annoyed me - felt weak - and I got a little lost. The second read-thru about 3 years later, I enjoyed the beginning just as much as the first time and the ending felt much better. I ""got"" it. Still not as funny as the main part of the book and that last bit of chapter 23 annoys me, but does provide good resolution.  Overall a 4.5.

714,4,ACFLHDXCQZ01K,B007AUY1EE,"Backtrack is a different type of time travel story, and as such, it can prove to be a challenge for the reader to keep track of where and when the story is occurring. It is fast-paced, and keeps your interest well. Just try not to be too picky on the time period something is happening, because it will almost assuredly change.

The challenge found in the book, is that time-travel can only be in one direction - backward. When one thinks about it, that is a logical concept. The thought of time as a single line is a fallacy. The myriad decisions made every instant of every day moves time forward in a way which would be impossible to duplicate; the amount of what must stay the same is beyond comprehension. Consequently, going backward is the only logical possibility. To change some future event, you must first experience it, and only then can you have any possibility of changing it, be it going back ten seconds or ten years.

This book deals in those questions, with a main character who gets thrown into a situation not of his choosing. He ""learns on the job"", so to speak, being tasked by the inventor of the time ring to stop a horrific terrorist attack that is three years in the future. How does he know? He lived through it and has come back to try stopping it. The problem is he is being hunted by some who know of this capability and want to stop it. The inventor passes the ring to the main character and charges him to complete the task.

Some things are almost humorous, such as re-meeting the same person many times due to jumping back; and some things start to drag the story down, such as enduring many jumps just to get something right.

Overall I think it was an excellent book, with some of the main problems being the villains. They seemed to be mostly clueless, except for the one head person. A spy thriller is not as thrilling when the villains never come close to winning.

Two kings to be, who are waiting for their turn to rule, are suddenly passed over, in order to make a union between two territories, and raise their son to power as ruler of the whole planet.  That instantly creates animosity towards the infant who is the future heir of everything.  It may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but turns out to be a fight to survive for the heir apparent.  That would be the death of him, if he didn't come equipped with some very interesting supernatural abilities.  It's one big rollercoaster ride with enough ups and downs to make you dizzy.

This is the second book I have read by Lucy Kevin, who is actually Bella Andre, and I enjoyed The Wedding Gift a great deal. At this time, the book is free and the audio is available for $1.99, a great deal. This is the first book in the Four Weddings and a Fiasco series.

Julie Delgados restaurant fails and she starts a job at Rose Chalet, a wedding planning and venue company. Unfortunately, the first wedding she must prepare the food for happens to be the brother of the celebrity chef who wrote a scathing review that helps shut the door on her fledgling restaurant.

Andrew Kyle is pleased to see Julie again. He remembers her and had seen her brilliance as a chef. However, she is too cautious and needs to allow her full creative genius out in her food preparation. He wants to help unleash her potential.

Can Julie put aside her hurt and see what he wants for her? Can they move beyond the differences and see they are actually made for each other?

I was actually amazed at the character development in this novella. I got a true sense of what made both of them tick. Also, the plot has a new twist that made this a highly enjoyable love story. My only suggestion be would a stronger ending. It felt a bit rushed to me. It has a happily for now ending. Of course, since this is the first book in this series, I suspect Ms. Kevin will have this couples relationship grow in the next book.

Julie Delgado is a great heroine. She is vulnerable but has determined to succeed even though she suffers a lot of disappointments. There is a surprising amount of depth to her character, considering the length of this book.

I fell in love with Andrew Kyle's character. At first, I wasn't sure about him because the first scene in the book does not show him in a favorable light, but once his motives unfold, then it makes sense. He wants Julie to find the full extent of her creative side.

I listened to the audio version, and as always, I thoroughly enjoyed Eva Kaminskys performance. She reads with a great deal of emotion and does a credible job on giving each character a distinct voice.

If you are looking for a light-hearted read with a unique plot and engaging characters, then you will enjoy The Wedding Gift as much as I did. I look forward to reading/listening to the other books in this delightful series. Happy reading!",Great start on another series!,2,2016-03-09

I felt her astonishment when a surprising man started showing romantic interest in her. And, I cheered her along to a satisfying conclusion -- and a happy ending. I didn't even mind her letters to Madeline that were strewn throughout the book. They were a little sad and strange, but they gave more insight into how Miss Moseley was thinking and feeling.

This book gives you everything you'd expect from a Regency Romance -- except for the letter from Madeline at the end. That's what threw me. Without giving too much away, it jolted me out of the sweet Regency period into something entirely different -- the supernatural. Have you ever eaten some delicious, sweet grapes and then bit into a bad one? That letter from Madeline was something like that bad grape for me. It ruined the flavor of the entire book and left me with a strange taste in my mouth.

I understand that the author was probably trying to set the reader up for another book. I get that. However, throwing a supernatural curve ball into a Regency romance is just too jarring. There are other ways outside of the actual story that the author could have introduced her other book.

Anyway, if it wasn't for that letter from Madeline at the end of the book, I would have given ""Miss Moseley The Matchmaker"" a 5-star rating.

The first part is little more than an emotional rant. The communist manifesto is completely untenable and unrealistic in any practical form. This is evinced since the advent of communism in Russia through every country that touts the communist ideal. This utopian idea, as Marx states himself, can only exist at the behest of a bourgeois already in existence and well developed that a proletariat might be created so that the communist philosophy may become necessary and thereby implemented. The society Marx outlines is devoid of any boundaries, towns, cities, provinces, states, counties, countries, and political parties. From its thrust into the world in Russia throughout every communist country currently in existence, not a single one of them reflects the philosophy and ideology of Marx's communism. All communist regimes are just as much a prime example of class distinction and class antagonism, albeit minus the ""right"" to publicly take any position not in line with the ruling communist class. Marx's philosophy directly opposes not only industrialization but also the advent and continued proliferation of a mechanized world. It is also a philosophy lacking any sense of values and character indemnified by Marx's open declaration that communists will ride on the back of any revolutionary movement they view as having the probability of overthrowing the ruling class of any nation regardless of that revolutionary movement's philosophy.

After reading this the naivety of Marx and his fellow communists of his era, the progenitors of the communist philosophy, it becomes abundantly obvious that power hungry, greedy men of unbounded avarice would see the communist philosophy as a means to their ends with the window of opportunity presently afforded them at the time. These men then used the guise of communist utopia to rally men to their cause, the poorer the better, to agitate them towards violence and ride the wave of revolution to victory and the establishment of yet another government that does not also create class distinction and oppression but brutally does so. Once these men are in power the result is similar to a monarchy without the opulence. Not only all power is invested in the ruling class but also so is all the national wealth held by the ruling class, just like it is in a monarchy.
Boundaries are not erased in any sense but are more firmly established and enforced even at the cost of death for anyone who would try to escape such a blissful existence.

The representative government authorized by a constitution is not, as no construct of men may not be, without its problems. Still, a government defined by the people of a nation, restricted by a constitution, and built upon inherent rights belonging to every human being, is far better than anything else the world had in the past or currently exercises.",A Utopian Manifesto,10,2017-11-30

744,1,A30WJKGX1XG19Q,B007IO7C6Q,"This book just didn't work for me.  Trey a country music superstar and alcoholic and womanizer decides he wants his wife back after being divorced for 5 years because he finds out that she's moving on and marrying someone else.  Sierra never really got over Trey and although she says she can't take him back it sure doesn't take him long to win her back.  In fact it's only a matter of days.

This book had a couple of things I really hate in a book:

1) The author's need to demonize the guy she doesn't stay with.  Why does the fianc have to end up being a horrible person.  (I wish author's didn't feel the need to make us hate the other guy - why can't we sympathize with him).  Sometimes things just don't work out but he doesn't have to be a complete villain.  And to top it all off he couldn't even perform sexually.  I mean really?  I didn't understand the need for the heroine to have not had sex with any one else since the divorce.  Especially since the hero was having sex with tons of women.

2)When they do have sex - no condom even though he was drunk all the time and had sex with a lot of other woman.  He insists he always used a condom (although he was so drunk I'm not sure how he can know this) and she believes him anyway.

3) The heroine gets blamed for the break-up because she kept something back from the hero.  Even though he was an alcoholic, left her alone two weeks after she lost their baby and was basically always out on tour or getting drunk in a bar.  All of a sudden she's to blame and she takes the blame on and feels guilty?  Way too much of a doormat for me.

4) Hero suddenly decides he's going to quit drinking and that's it.  Not really mentioned again except for going to one AA meeting.  As if it would be that simple.

5) The best friend who is his manager is really a JERK!  He doesn't seem to be looking out for his best friend more for his own pocketbook.  He hates the ex-wife and then does a complete 180 at the end with a less than believable explanation.

6) The Hero takes the easy way and lets his actions hurt the heroine.  When Trey's best friend brings the girl he's having sex with to his family's party when he brings his ex-wife Trey does nothing.  The girl throws herself at Trey and kisses him and says something that makes it obvious they are having sex and he does nothing even though his ex is right there and he knows this would hurt her.  Then later he dances with the ""girlfriend"" and even though he's breaking it off he doesn't let his ex know this so it just looks like he's enjoying dancing with the girlfriend.

Honestly, by the end of the book I didn't like Trey and I thought Sierra was a complete push over.  I was going to give this book two stars but after writing this I realize how much I didn't like this book and I'm giving it one star.",Unlikeable Hero and Doormat Heroine,8,2016-03-03

747,3,AW4NFCPN81CS3,B007K3D4CQ,"A CARESS OF WINGS is an e-novella (June 2012 release) in Sylvia Days Renegade Angels series.  Part of the series premise follows that if a Sentinel (Guardian Angel) falls in love or mates with a mortal/human their wings are removed and they become the Fallen.  As a Fallen, they are now vampire, and require blood to survive. But along the way, a few of the Fallen have requested leniency and begged off from vampire status and have become lycan-infused with demon blood with the capability to shift.  The lycans are currently on the run, hoping to escape servitude to the Sentinels.

A CARESS OF WINGS is a short story that follows the rescue of a human male-Trevor Descansos by Sentinel Angel Siobhan.  Trevor had been held prisoner by a horde of virus-infected vampires for over a year.  Tortured, sexually abused and used for his blood, Trevor begged for death. Weak and dying, all he knew was the daily pain and torment of hundreds of hungry mouths biting and clawing for his blood.  But when a beautiful angel freed Trevor from his chains, he knew death had granted his wish.

Siobhan is a researcher for the Sentinels. Knowing their blood was a cure for the vampire virus proved invaluable and dangerous at the same time.  If the vampires knew then every Sentinel would be targeted.  Looking for a cause to the vampire virus, it was one of Siobhans responsibilities to investigate and test new theories surrounding the virus that was quickly overtaking the vampire hordes. But finding a dying Trevor chained to a wall pulled at her heart.  Guilt ate at Siobhan for not finding Trevor sooner, but by infusing his blood with her own, Trevor would soon make a quick physical recovery.  But it was his emotional mind and his memories that would cause bigger problems for the pair, when Trevor and Siobhan begin to develop a strong attraction to each other.

A CARESS OF WINGS is a short story.  Siobhan was previously introduced in an earlier storyline and A Caress of Wings opens a premise into another potential Fallen Angel.  To be honest, in the beginning I had a difficult time connecting to the pair.  Perhaps it is because the Sentinels are without emotions, yet Siobhan most definitely felt something for Trevor. Trevors delirium was well written, but once he was back to health, his personality reminded me of a puppy lost and looking for someone with whom to play.  Also, the premise of The Fallen Angels is technically lost when the current crop of storyline characters does not meet with the same fate as previous Angels who fell.  Perhaps, like real life, the Sentinels have evolved and learned from their mistakes in the past. An interesting storyline, and one that I hope Sylvia continues throughout the series.  Now that a number of Angels are falling for humans, there will have to be a resolution that will satisfy everyone. Looking forward to A Hunger So Wild.",3.5 stars...,2,2016-03-10

I read a lot of romance books, all types, this was a change from those although there was some romance in it. There was also suspense, danger, surprises, lots of characters, the gal Cassidy Christensen doesn't get the names of everyone she calls them descriptive names and they stick, like ""Hot Redhead"" she didn't like that gal, she was annoying and always in the way.  In addition to two hot men pursuing this gal, and some bad men she couldn't seem to shake at times.  There were many characters and they were really all a part of a well woven mystery that came down to Cassidy Christensen's family her Mom and Dad who had been killed.  They were a part of why they had been killed and what they had been doing in Mexico, it wasn't what Cassidy thought they went there to do.
Seems everything that she knew about her family members was all messed up.  Secrets to be revealed when you buy this great book and read it!

Running from a scheming redhead intent on making her life miserable. Running from painful memories that sabotage her dreams of happiness. With two very tempting men competing for her attention, she hopes she'll finally have someone to run to, but can she trust either of them? When secrets from her past threaten her family, Cassidy decides to stop running and fight for her future.

So, I will rewrite it briefly this time.
I loved it. Rose captured my heart from the beginning and kept it until the end.
Travis Burnett is a tough, handsome, stubborn, hard, rancher cut in the mold of his daddy. He had his mind set on the perfect wife who didn't exist. Poor Rose, left alone at a tender age, she's now only 21, is simply trying to provide an existence for herself and her loyal manservant/substitute father. He is all she has in the world. So, she she does palm reading and seances- for money. Travis's mother, Eugenia goes to her to find her missing son from the war. He never returned. They, the girls, form a friendship of sorts. Mom hatches a plan.
Rose is the victim. 
This book is darling. It's also free.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I received this book as a gift in exchange for an experienced, honest review. I have done this...twice. The characters are realistic and endearing. Rose broke my heart and I cried buckets for her. I laughed at their escapades .

753,5,AGBGV16NY06FW,B007PPJOGO,"I have read this before and enjoyed it so much I decided to read it again. This was a great read full of twist and turns that makes this an outstanding love story. Rose performs sance to make her way for her dream job. It looks like she picked the wrong women when she started helping Mrs. Burnett whose son isn't happy and calls her a fraud and demands she move to another town. Deciding it is time to move on there is an issue of a missing piece of jewelry and Travis will have nothing of this he goes and gets Rose bring her to the ranch where she will stay until the missing piece is found. Eugenia has decided to play match marker she thinks Rose and Travis make the perfect pair. As she tries to bring these two together Travis isn't having anything to do with it. Why would he want to marry someone who steals from old women, if he was looking for a bride it sure wouldnt be Rose. Rose won't marry anyone who doesnt trust her but Eugenia is having none of this.

Eugenia is a wonderful sweet character that you fall in love with fast. She wants her sons happily married with grandbabies to bounce on her knees and will do anything to make this happen. I loved that Rose and Travis were both strong will people who didn't take any crap it make it a more interesting read. You have two people who are so attracted to each other but neither willing to give in. They sure do put up a good fight but with mother doing her best it isn't easy to walk away. Rose is one feisty lady that takes your heart she isn't afraid to stand on her own two feet not taking any crap she is a strong caring woman who knows her own mind.
Travis is only looking out for his mother and their ranch he will do anything to protect them. There is no way he will let anyone take advanced of his beloved mother. He needs to put some color in his life not everything is black and white. I just adored this over protective man. No doubt about it he is alpha all the way. He stands up for what he believes even if he might be wrong he stands his ground until he is proven wrong.

There is nothing I didn't like about this story the author writes a wonderful story of conflict, passion, truly finding what you need not what you think you want. I love how these two stands up to each other and give as good as they get which makes a very interesting reading. I found this to be a humorous read laughing as Rose swearing at Travis in French than has to translate to tell him what she called him. This was a well written story that entertains the reader giving you a book you cannot put down. It isn't a read that you want to start late at night or you will be staying up late to finish it. I adored this plot and cannot wait to read more in this series. I love audios and I see the author has a few I might just have to pick those up.

If you are looking for a romance that keeps the characters on their toes, full of humor, with strong characters that have no trouble standing up saying what they think why pushing the line with a pushy mother who wants to see her family happy this is the book for you. This is one author that knows how to keep her readers invested as she spins a tale of that takes you away wishing you could be part of this family. I know you will enjoy this as much as I have and will want to read the rest of the series.",Wonderful humorous read that is very entertaining,2,2016-05-14
754,5,A2943E4WX8TZBA,B007PPJOGO,"I recently found this author through Amazon, and I am glad I did.  This book is a fun western romance. Rose is a decent woman trying to make a living during an era when women either were married, or worked as prostitutes.  She is trying to take care of herself and not hurt anyone.  Travis is a rancher who sees everything in black or white.  With the help of his creative, loving mother, and Rose's strong personality, he will find that what he wanted in a woman is not what he needs.  He has met his match in Rose.  She stands up to him and gives as good as she gets.  These characters were so fun to read about.  Rose is so funny when she us swearing at him in French, and she has to translate to tell him what she called him.  This book was not your typical western, with an outlaw out to get the hero or heroine.  It is a funny, romantic story that just happens to take place in Texas in the late 1800's.

The story revolves around a rebellious teen who ran away and made life very complicated.  She thought she was winning, but the reality was she was losing herself.

The story, again held a lot of promise, but the delivery is another matter altogether.  There were a lot of typo and grammatical errors in the Kindle edition.  Also, I couldn't imagine how a woman can go from 150 to 60 kg by skipping meals for days, exercising to the extreme, taking laxatives, without so much a hint of physical harm!  I'd thought people who try to lose weight that way died eventually!

I liked Vanessa's grit and intelligence and the fact that Arthur genuinely admired her for those qualities.  He was protective and humorous, and admitted to feeling like a better man when with Vanessa.

I liked Arthur and Vanessa, and I really liked it when the Kellington family was part of the scene because humor surrounds all of their interactions.

It takes on the old system of kings and knighthood while incorporating old legends and creatures to make the novel flow with the medieval feeling you get when reading it. The way DeFillipis uses the thirteen men to start a quest (which I realize thirteen is a commonly used number because of its origins, but nevertheless) reminds me a bit of Chaucer and of J. R. R. Tolkeins novels and the way men were chosen to go out on a mission in order to maintain the worlds balance. I was impressed with the composition of the characters because for having so many, DeFilippis was able to give each character their own unique tag that let you relate to them on some level.

760,4,AUZ3EJAU37NC5,B007SCX46K,"First of all, this is not a novel.  It's a collection of actual newspaper articles written in the 1890s by American journalist Elizabeth Banks (1872-1938), recounting some of her ""undercover"" experiences in Victorian English society.  This was quite the find for me.  It's a fascinating read by a pioneering woman who lived a fascinating life.  (Just google her.  You'll be amazed.  College graduate, then typewriter girl, then society reporter, then secretary at the American Consulate in Peru, then ""stunt journalist"", and, upon her move to London, an investigative journalist for publications such as THE DAILY NEWS, PUNCH, ST. JAMES GAZETTE, LONDON ILLUSTRATED and REFEREE.  She also worked to promote women's suffrage and counted as friends or acquaintances George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, H.G. Wells and suffragette Henrietta Marston.  She made major contributions to British intelligence before and during WWI and worked to draw America into the war.  Well, wow.  Maybe even more admirable than better known journalist Nellie Bly.)

She wrote about the plight of the lower classes and the articles included here are the result of her undercover work as (1) housemaid, (2) street sweeper, (3) Covent Garden flower girl, and (4) laundry girl.  In addition there's a section on the ""Almighty Dollar"" in which she recounts her experiences posing as an American heiress seeking help breaking into upper class society.  She shows how some English aristocrats sold their social influence with only regard for making money.  However, she also exposes the ""shoddiness"" of some of these Americans looking for upward mobility.

When Banks originally set off for England in 1892 (I believe), her parting injunction by her editor was ""Don't forget that you are an American and are going to England simply to compare the inferiorities of that country with the superiorities of your own.""  And, indeed, one of her first articles upon arriving was ""An American Girl's Reply to Mr. Kipling"" printed in response to Kipling's criticisms of America in the Times. That was the beginning of her journalistic career in London.

This collection of articles was originally published as CAMPAIGNS OF CURIOSITY; Journalistic Adventures of an American Girl in London, published in 1894.  In it she relates her adventures and her insights into life as a lower-class working girl.  The articles are a great look at how these women lived and, although not completely unbiased, are a rather fair expose of working conditions and the relationship of upper and lower classes.  This is an informative read, well written with surprising modern writing style, and with some great understated humor.","Undercover investigative reporting in Victorian England.

767,5,A1WQQF1U3Z4FI,B007VO5VAC,"I honestly loved this shortish novel. A lot of reviewers complained about poor editing, but I suspect that, as they were older reviews, I may have received a re-edited copy. I found only an occasional glitch. The story begins with Margaret (Meg) Holstock, a 28 year old bluestocking spinster, who has been given over the care of her 10 year old orphaned nephew Emmett, and his lovable but enormous Mastiff, Perseus. Meg was sister to Emmett's mother, who married his father against his father's family's wishes, which resulted in the family cutting them off. Meg and Emmett travel to Honeysuckle cottage, in the village of Cobbitty, Surrey, that Emmett has inherited. When they arrive, they find the cottage nearly inhabitable, but Meg is determined to make the best of it. Along the way she hires Alice, a village girl who is a wiz at all things domestic, along with her beau, the nearly silent Ned. Meg eventually meets her notorious neighbor, Lucien,
Viscount Chetwyn, while walking in the woods. Chetwyn is an unapologetic rake who lives hard, plays hard, and has frequent debauched parties, when he is in residence. Chetwyn is intrigued by Meg, who isn't the least bit put off by his frankness or his sly innuendos. They continue to meet, and they are drawn together by shared interests and mutual intelligence. The dialogue is sparkling and their relationship progresses in a very natural, realistic way. Eventually Chetwyn, who has a dark past and a terrible reputation, feels that his presence in her life can only be detrimental to her, so he tries to pull away from the only decent relationship he has ever had. ""Things"" happen, and he flees to Italy. Meanwhile, Emmett's paternal aunt and uncle show up to remove him from an ""unsuitable"" situation (read the book to find out why!) and Meg is doubly devastated. Of course there is a HEA, with a lovely epilogue. For those who want to know, there are a few passionate kisses and lustful longings, but any actual sex scenes (near the end of the book) are conducted behind closed doors. All in all, a lovely story.","Lovely story, wonderful dialogue!",5,2017-03-06

I was completely enthralled, and through the dialogue we get to know and love the H and the h. I commend the author; this is clearly her great strength.

One reason is because they are so good you know (even if you're as cheap as I am) that no matter the cost you are going to continue to buy each installment. And then it's so good that you don't stop reading when you should be going to bed because you work a 10 hour shift the next morning.

I had a love/hate relationship with the heroine Amaranthe because she was just so nave and continued to be nave with a big pinch of reckless behavior added to the recipe. Two qualities that together easily made her someone I would want to slap over and over again. But then again because these books were so good of course the most irritating actions led to scenes that made you re-read them just so they could be forever ingrained in your psyche.

I really don't understand why an author would deliberately overuse one word. That one word, just simply ruined it for me. I am now a little more than half way through Forged in Blood I and it's just getting really tedious and the story is starting to drag. Maybe this is what happens when you find a series after it has concluded rather that reading them one at a time as they are released. I don't know. But the author said she had meant to conclude the series with this book, but the characters just didn't want to go peacefully into the night, so Forged in blood II is next. But, even that didn't seem to finish it up as I see there a couple more after that. In my humble opinion, this story should have been condensed. The parts that were good were really good. Some parts are laugh out loud funny. But there is just too much filler to drag it out. The characters themselves, are very likable and develop well as it goes along. You do find yourself routing for them, but the situations just keep getting sillier and I swear, the whole series was written only to find ways for the characters to wind up naked. Maybe it should've been called the emperor's new clothes. And why are the characters later on in the series suddenly ending their sentences in eh? Are the Turgonians Canadian?

Yes, as others mentioned, the writing style is simple, but the story itself is interesting.  It starts out immediately as a mystery and then more mysteries are layered on top.  The two main characters are Aidan and Jade, who, based on the descriptions in the book, may be the most beautiful, perfect humans who ever lived.  They talk about how beautiful they are a lot and they talk about how other people think they are beautiful a lot. That gets a little boring since it seems the author believes only beautiful and perfect people can be interesting and have strange and mysterious things happen to them.

You'll probably figure out what's going on before the end of the book, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good story.  Strange things are happening and you'll want to know how and why.  The supporting characters are of no great interest (I guess they're not beautiful and perfect enough).

This is a seven-volume series.  I don't think I'll be reading the rest of them, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth reading.  There is an interesting mystery here.

THE HOSTAGE BARGAIN  Melinda is working at the bank when the robbers hit.  She ends up being taken hostage and since she has a huge issue with the owner of the bank, she helps them get away.  Then she ends up staying for their next job to get money to help save her family farm.  The only problem is that she ends up falling for the hot alpha bank robbers.

So, I loved these three books.  Yes, they have to be read in order to really enjoy them.  This box is a great way to do it.  They were more than I expected.  The covers recently changed and now they have a lighter feel to them which is reflective of the story inside.  Yes, the God Pack boys have dark pasts and there are threats to them, but there are also some very funny moments.  A great series!

The heroine provided a bit of sass which added some humor to the abundant sexy times.

Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be the ""original"" story I was expecting. As I began making comparisons to Laurell K. Hamilton's ""Guilty Pleasures"".  These comparisons were not complementary to Nicola Clare's writing style as it appears she heavily copied her characters from Hamilton's series. Examples given below.

Lucinda Monk - (  Mimic of Anita Blake) is a vampire Hunter who is a little more than human and drawn to Michel Durand. She exhibits traits which make her less susceptible to vampire powers but she doesn't know why. Where Anita Blake knows she can raise the dead as a Necroromacer.

Michel Durand Master of the City - (Mimic of Jean-Claude Master of the City. Michel like Jean-Claude is a Master of the City, for the city of Auckland New Zealand. He owns a Night Club called Sensations. He knows the secret to who Luce is. His pet name for her is ""Ma Douce"" you even expect him to say ""Ma Petite""  and he eventually does.

Rick (Mimic of Richard) is Luce's friend and adversary of Michel. Much like Richard's character.

Outside of the comparisons the book is so-so a few parts interest me but, not enough to be convinced that book two would be worth reading. Actually it did make me want to read ""Guilty Pleasures"" again lol. Couldn't recommend this book to others.",A Mimic Of Guilty Pleasures,3,2016-05-11

Or I would tell you, if I were still smart enough to do so, but I'm pretty sure my IQ is hovering around room-temperature now. As best as I can remember, there were uncountable incidents of commas missing where they should be, and existing where they should not. If you created a drinking game where you took a shot for each comma problem, you'd be tipsy by page 2, alcohol-poisoned a few pages after that, and dead by the end of chapter 1.

801,1,A6KS9D2K8G56E,B0082CA0Z8,"I saw ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" and made the mistake of assuming this would be readable without first checking the reviews. Big mistake. The review by ReadsTooMuch hits on a few of the things that annoyed me about this book, but there are a few others.

To start with, the entire premise is insane. We're supposed to believe that four of Rhode Island society's wealthiest families have entrusted their daughters and huge wads of cash to a young, unmarried woman they've only known briefly, have no connections to, and who has an uncontrollable temper and a habit of swearing. They expect her to chaperone their daughters to England on a ship full of sailors without maids or any sort of protection, to introduce them to London society (not noticing that she's never been to London before), and find them aristocratic husbands, even though neither she nor they has an appropriate, female, married sponsor who is well enough established to supervise their coming outs. How much cash? A London season in the early Regency period cost at least 5,000 pounds, which (if you're familiar with Pride and Prejudice) was 25% more than the very wealthy Mr. Bingley earned in a year. All this because, in the highly patriotic, anti-British atmosphere of early post-Revolution America, they are utterly dazzled at the thought of a English title.

Despite coming from very well-off, aristocracy idolizing families, on arriving in London these young women were incapable of behaving appropriately in any situation. Apparently, the author was unaware that early 19th century America actually had polite society and that these women would be very familiar with the rules of etiquette. Of course, as soon as they misbehaved in the slightest, they were immediately shunned by everyone of consequence and excluded from every event, never mind that this was commonly known as The Age of Scandal and every hostess in London would have been competing to get them to spice up their parties.

Even less believable was an incident on the trip to London when one of the women, on her first try, climbed the rigging of a sailing ship with only one hand while wearing the full-length, soft, billowy skirts and petticoats of the period. She accomplished this feat while carrying an apparently idiotically-designed, open-flame lantern with no protective shielding. Not only did the captain-owner of the ship not object, he didn't even stick around to see how horribly wrong this was going to go. Likewise, when she attached the unsafe lamp to the rigging, no one bothered to check that she'd done it properly, resulting in the entire rigging catching fire. How did this happen? Well, she was given the task by her suitor, a young man who was variously described as a fisherman and a shipbuilder, who in some unexplained way had managed to learn how to work a multi-masted cargo ship without the need of any sort of training and wriggled his way into the crew with enough trust to carry out complex nautical tasks unsupervised, all so he could follow his lady love to London unnoticed. Sorry, but fishing boats and long-distance cargo ships were not similar enough that sailing one meant you knew how to sail the other, nor does building ships teach you how to sail them. Why he didn't simply pay for his passage is not explained either.

Then there's the hero, who at the grand old age of 32, is apparently on his fifth career since finishing university. He's done something or other so impressive that he was granted the title of Marquess, learned to run a printing press, established a printing business, learned to sail and captain a ship, and built a shipping empire. And he started those business from scratch, with no start-up money from dad. Apparently the only thing he hasn't done is manage or even visit the estates that he got with the title, because that's how new titles work in Britain, which means he's completely the welfare of all the people associated with the estate who are entirely his responsibility.

Others have pointed out that Blair can't do math. She also doesn't understand early 19th century American society, early 19th century English society, the nature of a landed aristocracy, the concept of the learning curve, or the laws of physics. Throw in a ludicrously naive and erratic heroine and a predictable plot and this book is a serious trainwreck. It would be more believable, just as it is, if was marketed as a parody of bad period romances.",could easily pass for a parody of bad period romance writing,11,2016-01-24
802,1,AXNO6EWMZFIHL,B0082YUELG,"I only wish there was a rating lower than 1 star  I would definitely giver here. This author was or is only interested in impressing the reader with his ridiculous  vocabulary.  I do believe he sat with a book of synonyms next to his computer as he wrote the story.  IU am a handicapped person hat sits mostl of the day reading.  I read approximately 100 to 125  fiction or non fiction novels a year.  My vocabulary likewise is very vast and comprehensive.  If I see  a word I do not recognize I look it up. I have no trouble understanding the ""words"" the author writes BUT there is no rhythm or semblances of necessity when he strings phrase after phrase of meaningless verbiage together. Let me give an example and I quote from chapter 6 "" they walked into Arcadia where shepherds pipe. They had taken life for granted as do creatures of the woods, forgetful of the edits of a world had obtruded itself and shattered a dream..........Hitherto he had taken from life what he wanted but already he was grappling with the blind fear of a fate for once to strong for him.""  What in the hell is he taking about???? This is a western?? The cover shows a knock down drag out western scene but this garble is all you get in this tripe.

809,4,A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,B0083E6LBM,"These short stories, (currently there are nine), are set in 1950's Britain, and many editorial reviews and descriptions compare them favorably to the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and Enid Blyton's Famous Five series. The comparison to the work of Enid Blyton is particularly apt. The stories vary a little bit in their age appeal, with some stories feeling a bit more advanced in terms of plot, dialogue, and characterization than others. To me, the stories seem to fit in between Blyton's early reader Secret Seven tales and her slightly older Famous Five. They are much younger than classic era Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.

I think the Moxham full length books, (there are currently seven), that feature these same characters are more rewarding than the short stories, which shouldn't be surprising. In the books you have more characters, more red herrings, more adventures and just a bigger canvas. For older readers, or for kids who have read all of the stories, I'd be on the lookout for those books. (For what it's worth, I'd try to read the first book, ""Mystery of Smuggler Cove"", first. It sets up the locale, the four kids, and the supporting characters. After that you can pretty much mix up the books and stories and read them out of order without missing the thread.)

The short stories are nice little snacks, and are great as an introduction to old-school mystery/action/adventure. The kids are just sketched in because you are familiar with them. There are fewer scenes, a little less suspense, and the wrap ups are a bit more pat. But, that's the nature of the short story and it shouldn't dissuade one from scooping them up to read as fun quickies.

Consider this story. Joe, his sisters Amy and Sarah, and friend Will are larking about and decide to look for hidden loot from an old robbery. There is an abandoned castle nearby, (why did I grow up near an abandoned quarry pit instead of a castle? That's why you need books like this.). Anyway, you end up with dungeons, bad guys, tunnels, escapes, captures, more escapes, cliffs, danger and derring do. Thrilling things happen and justice is done. Throughout it all the kids demonstrate grit, resourcefulness, courage, and loads of all the right stuff.  The story is briskly paced, the action is clear, scenes are effectively set, and dialogue is fairly realistic in an action/suspense sort of way. Somebody almost always has a flashlight/torch with him.

This is a pretty nice package for an early reader. The effect is a bit of a thrill, and if it encourages the reader's taste for further reading, (and day dreaming), then that's just the icing on the cake.

A mother (Jen) has just gone through a divorce that her now ex-husband filed for because he decided that he'd rather be with the children's nanny.  The book focuses on Jen trying to put her life back together after the divorce. The one constant that I did notice throughout the entire book was references to God and having a personal relationship with Him.

While many might want to overlook this book because of the funeral home setting, I appreciated how the setting gave me a new way to look at showing God's love by preparing people's bodies for their burial. Everything that goes into a funeral is done for the living. Showing God's love through death to those that are still living. As a Christian I know that death is not the end, but a new beginning.

Angela Hunt did an amazing job with this book. Although this books main theme was in reference to God in our lives - at no point was it being shoved down the readers throat. Instead, it was a constant theme that tied the whole story together. It allowed the reader to see how God's love  is reflected in us showing others love, in forgiving others, and in loving ourselves.

Prayer was also a constant point. God answers our prayers in His time and in His way.  The main character, Jen, discovers that God always answers our prayers...just not always the way we want Him to.

I would suggest that you get a cup of tea, a box of Kleenex, and find a comfy spot to curl up and read.  You WILL enjoy this book and find yourself wanting to know even more about Jen and her boys by the end. I was SO happy to see that this book was the first in a series!

I found this book to be an interesting story of one womans spiritual journey as she approaches her altered future holding the hands of her two young sons after her husband divorces her because of his involvement with another woman.

If you have seen the movie Hope Floats, then in many ways this is the Christian version, but with a few twists. The writing is solid and the character development is gradual. In fact, I really didn't like Jennifer (Jen) or her mother Joella, but as Jen matured spiritually and looked deeper into her own heart I found myself in her corner cheering her on through her challenges, trials and tribulations. I also had a few LOL moments courtesy of her eldest son. So typical of a young teen.

Martin Caidin has painted several honest pictures of the P-38from its inception, through teething, compressability and myriad improvements. He portrays it in the USA, Alaska, crossing the Atlantic, the ETO, Africa and the westen Pacific. It was always a good aircraft and then became a great one. Great airplanes aren't only built on the drawing board and the factory floor; great airplanes become great because brave and talented young men make them whirr and whip and loop and shoot. Caidin brought the aviators who flew the Forktailed Devil to life, often in their own words. When using his own, he's a fine writer and his descriptions come alive. Reading about these fliers in the P-38 compliments and confirms the detailed research and presentation about the creation of the Lightening. As a naval aviator, I pined reading the book, wanting my hands on those throttles and yoke. Damn, I sure wish I was old enough to buy one of those 500 surplus, brand new P-38's parked in the Arizona desert after the war for the princely sum of $1,250.","Great Plane, Great Book",8,2017-03-08

It happens to the best of us. I guess as long as he's selling books, he'll continue to churn them out. But there comes a time when it's better to wrap it up than to go on and on, fighting the same monsters in different locations and hired by different characters. The sexual content is more implied than explicit, which is fine with me. The book doesn't need any more painful descriptions of perky breasts and flat stomachs and rippling abs. Oh, the foursome in the medieval hot tub was pretty funny, even though it wasn't described at all. The mental image of our grizzled Geralt, some strange fellow called ""Three Jackdaws"", and two warrior women was entertaining enough.

820,4,A1G73RR2GIOBBP,B008E7JZT8,"This beautifully written novel is of a post-apocalyptic world where animals have increased intelligence, societies, and  customs;  and humans are long gone - maybe. The protagonists are all cats although other societies such as dogs and rats exist. Something has been killing cat-seers in a remote monastery, so a group of cats (lions, tigers, etc.) including a Captain of the queen's guard, a Major. a Scholar, an Alchemist, and the Captain's brother are dispatched by their Empress to stop the killings and protect those still alive. One seer is found still alive, so the group of six continues on to find the cause of the deaths. The general flavor of their behavior and society is Japanese, Shogun-like and feudal.

The  characterizations are very strong, consistent, and well done, Each member of the group contributes to their survival although their individual motivations are obscure, especially those of the alchemist and the seer. Their journey is difficult because of the mountains and weather although they follow something similar to the great wall of China with its frequent posts manned (?) by cat soldiers. The bulk of the story concerns the expedition with its trials and tribulations. Their rigid code of conduct is frequently tested, especially when they establish psychic  contact with something, possibly an Ancestor.

829,1,A3BVQHM1C6B9UW,B008EJOBH2,"Wow. I get this on one level. Let's put together a basic guide with a catchy title. That was the notion behind the ""Dummies"" series. At least there is some heft to one of those books. This one is six pages. It is a hodgepodge of truisms and some thoughts that should not be mixed together. There is little logic in the order they are presented. So it is dangerous for anyone attempting to apply it. Consider this notion, spend at least 6% of your revenues in better marketing. There is no substantiation to this and it does not allow for differences in industry.

That led me to a question. Who is the target audience? I only picked it up because it was free. The ""book"" touts itself as ""Probably the most condensed primer you'll ever read on building and marketing your business."" That seems true with the result being an incredibly irrelevant take on a complex and very human business practice.

I cannot think of a single client of mine that would find value or applicability in these six pages. They read like crib notes from a Philip Kotler book...which you should read instead.

This novella stands alone, and can be enjoyed by anyone. However, it will hold special delight for anyone who has read previous books featuring the Taggerts. This is a contemporary story and features ""Mac"" Taggert as the hero.

This is a novella, yet it is incredible how much depth of characters and story Jude Deveraux incorporates in this most enjoyable read. As with most of Ms. Deveraux's stories, there is humor and crackling dialogue. There is also a need to be willing to suspend some disbelief; if for some reason it is beyond one's sensibility that two people can fall truly in love within a span of days, then this is not a story for you. If you can accept that some things may not be common, but that doesn't make them impossible, and if you enjoy a glorious happy ever after, then I definitely recommend this. I also particularly recommend this for anyone who likes Christmas novellas",A Favorite Classic Holiday Novella,4,2017-01-01
832,4,A2KUR0ZBNV17AA,B008O58I4S,"Just Curious by Jude Devereaux is a novel I found that I thought would be appropriate for Christmas Day. No crime, no horror, no bad words, and an interesting story with a truly surprising ending makes this an almost perfect review post for Christmas day. There is just a little bit of sex but it is tastefully done and appropriate to the story. It is very definitely written for women, but, hey, a guy can enjoy a well-written story no matter the original target audience.

Karen works in the office of McAllister Taggert, ostensibly as a secretary. But Karen has a secret. She sees herself as an industrial spy. By volunteering to help everyone, work longer hours, and listen to others rather than speak, she intends to become a chief competitor of Taggert when she opens her own business. Before husband Ray died, she and Ray had worked in a failing enterprise and turned it around. If Ray had not died so early, Karen and Ray might have taken the business over. After Ray's death, the only way she could keep her financial interest in the business was to sleep with the remaining partner. Karen decided to start a new business was preferable. Taggert enterprises would be her training ground.

Ray was Karen's true love. It had been two years since his death and she had no interest in finding a replacement. With the biological clock ticking, Karen did want at least one child. She was not interested in getting married. There was a clinic she had visited; she had seen a catalog from which she could pick desirable genetic characteristics.

In the meantime, she is working for Taggert, an unmarried attractive person except for his personality. It seems he almost has a hobby of getting engaged and breaking the engagements days before the weddings. He surrounds himself with a staff of beautiful women, many of whom have sinecures for jobs. Taggert has a reputation as a narcissist and borderline misogynist. And he has a problem. He was invited to a wedding where he would be one of the groom's attendants. He has to attend the wedding and knows that a former fiance will be there. He cannot show up without an escort. He offers employment to Karen to act as an escort (non-sexual).

She accepts; the two go to the Taggert family mansion where the entire rather extended family is present for the wedding. There is only one bedroom for the two of them. See where this is going?

The story after this could get dull. It does not. Devereaux keeps the reader's attention throughout the rest of the novella. The dialogue is interesting, the pace is fast, the characters have more development than I would expect in such a short work. I will use some of her work in my English as a Second Language classes.","Interesting For the Guys, Too",4,2016-12-24

I almost stopped reading with the graphic scene of rape of the boy, b/c I felt it unnecessary to the story just grotesque, but if you can trudge along, it gets a little better. Once most of the characters are introduced, the story flows better. There are some grammatical errors, & alot of redundancy. But, again the plot is intriguing enough to wade through it.

836,2,A3TOMKJ8AD12G2,B008SGZOL8,"Unlike K.J. Jacksons novels Promise and Vow, Flame Moon did not make me cry heartfelt tears; it just frustrated me. My thoughts have nothing to do with historical vs. contemporaryIll read any genreand everything to do with the stories and characters. I might have liked it better at half this length. I read to the middle of chapter 19 (way further than I wanted to), then skipped to read the last half of chapter 21 to get to the end. Some of the amnesia and PTSD parts were good. The sex got repetitive, as did the agonies and betrayals. Content includes gore, kidnapping, prolonged torture.

The romance was a nope. Ditto for the friends and lovers severely wounding each other on purpose out of anger during training. The narrative point-of-view was clunky: maybe eighty percent Skye and twenty from her three new friends, and it wasn't mixed well. My favorite characters were Rafe (the heroic dog), and friends Triaten and Charlotte. Some elements similar to the 1996 Geena Davis movie The Long Kiss Goodnight.

Yet the boy is the strongest of the characters, likable, smart, funny with common wit. He goes farther than most of his ilk would, yet comes home for the simple life, eschewing the big city and its illicit lures. The writing is very simple, a bit dull, in spite of some simple views about city life vs. living in small towns and rural farms.

She has deleted her blog and is not responding to her readers on social media.  Her books are not standalones, and book six, Heller's Regret ended in a cliffhanger.

I would not purchase these books at this time.

Edit:  As I said earlier in another  discussion, J.D. will pop up on Facebook once or twice at the beginning of each year to claim that she is finishing the series that year. And then she doesn't. Year after year. Her son is off to university and she has a fairly mild condition that is easily treated. I know because I have the same condition.

Also, I was the main moderator on her Goodreads group until last year (I quit because I didn't like how she was treating her fans) and was privy to the fact that while she was claiming illness, she was also living an active life that conflicts with her claim of illness. I won't give more details as she does have some expectation of privacy.

However, she has removed her author blog and website. Despite her once a year protest, she has not released a book for almost four years. She used to publish twice a year and give constant progress reports. The bottom line is that it is unlikely she will finish the series.

At this point her faithful fans get angry with me, but I don't want new readers buying these books expecting that this is a complete series. I and several others have contacted Amazon and Audibel and received full refunds. I strongly suggest you do this and write reviews letting people know that the author has stopped writing.

841,5,A2ZSFKTJZUJ1SK,B008VSIMOY,"In reviewing a book I have read my first criterion is how was the story? This story was very good. My second criteria is how were the characters? In this story the characters, and the divide between them, are clearly drawn. And then I ask myself, how did I feel about the characters? In this book I loved the characters that I was supposed to love and hated the characters that I was supposed to hate. The dichotomies drawn between good and evil were stark and easily fathomed. Finally I ask myself how the book grew from place to place and what foreshadowing I saw? This book was filled with foreshadowing that then became flashbacks. Those are devices I have used myself. I saw the foreshadowing easily enough and drew the conclusions I was supposed to draw. That made the twists of the book a little less suspenseful but it did not detract from the story or the presentation of ending. The one twist I did not see was in the climactic event of the book though it too had been foreshadowed. \
There are many morals to this story. If you are looking for a shallow and only an entertaining story this is probably not for you. It has depth and it has philosophy that occupies the thoughts of the characters and the reader. I give it a five star rating even though it angered me in many places.

It's mostly the sanitized stuff you would expect from the era.  Violence is muted, sexuality non-existent, authority is to be respected, good triumphs over evil.  Character development is generally poor, because, it seems to me, the author wants the reader to identify with the main character, so they are hardly defined at all.  Still, these stories stretched the imagination, and made you think.  They were also optimistic about the future, which seems to be a forgotten art.  No, it doesn't subvert the dominant paradigm, but I am so tired of that anyway.  This was social vaccination, a sign of what people were worried about at the time.

To summarize the plots, in Icerigger a small group of commonwealth citizens are stranded on an ice world with a primitive civilization, thousands of miles from the commonwealth outpost. This is their story of how they interact with the natives and make their way to the the outpost. In Mission to Moulokin, the group of humans works on creating a world government so the natives can apply for an elevated membership in the commonwealth. In The Deluge Drivers, they encounter and deal with a plot by other humans to terraform the planet and make it suitable for human occupation.

These three novels were written over a significant number of years, and it shows. The first two books came fairly early in Foster's writing career, and subsequently lack some of the awesomeness that characterizes his later works.

858,3,A3PIN1MPTAQ4JC,B0091T62FS,"I've got another novel by this author on my Kindle, but if it's anything like this novella, I doubt I'll get to it anytime soon. First, despite it being a professionally published book, I was surprised by the proofreading errors (""as"" for ""at""; ""that"" for ""what"") and editing errors (having your protagonist describe her reflection in a mirror is a huge no-no). And what's this with all the ""began""s. He began to ___; she began to ___. Why not just have your characters do something? Why add that unnecessary ""began""? And why ever does she break into new paragraphs in such random places? But apparently the editors at Bethany House are okay with it, so who am I to complain?

As for the story, we learn in chapter two the whole plot is built on a misunderstanding that can be cleared up in a single conversation. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have a misunderstanding stretched on and on until you're ready to scream, ""Oh come on! Just talk already!"" If a couple can't handle something so simple, how will they face the more serious issues marriage and family present? Clearly these two are not meant for one another, and the more I read, the more convinced I became. Who would possibly want to marry a girl who causes nothing but trouble?

But it's an amusing read, if you don't take it too seriously. You see the ending coming from the moment we learn there's another man involved (somewhere on page 5, I think), but there's nothing wrong with building towards the happy ending the reader is expecting. And it would have been a happy ending, if I didn't think Charlotte was insane and Henry was making a terrible mistake marrying her. For me, this book was nails on a chalkboard, and I doubt I'll be reading anything else by this author, even if it does come up for free.",Nails on a Chalkboard,4,2016-10-08

Charlotte Wilson, at the ripe old age of twenty one, has decided that she is an old maid.  However, she doesn't want to live her whole life alone so she decides to pray to God to send her a suitable man.  And shortly thereafter, she runs into Mr Hamilton Beckett.  I mean that quite literally, she ran into Mr Beckett.  Apparently, Charlotte is prone to mishaps.  Moreover, she believes that Hamilton is the answer to her prayers.
Henry St James is Charlotte's best friend.  He has been away for two years and is back just in time to be dragged into Charlotte's matrimonial schemes.  The trouble is that Henry is in love with Charlotte, but he thinks Charlotte thinks of him as a friend.  And Charlotte IS TRYING to think of Henry as a friend.  She's just not succeeding too well.  Will they figure it out?

This story was a fast, humorous read.  Charlotte's antics were hilarious!  Poor Henry just can't seem to say no.

This book has kept me up too late, and kept me from getting to work on time. Very captivating. I have only one complaint. From the sales rank of all the books, it's beyond clear that the author can afford to have the series proofread. Why not do it? If you have a beautiful model and you're doing a photoshoot, you'd wipe specks of dirt off the model's face, right? It's a distraction when I'm cruising along, loving the story, eager to discover what's going to happen next - because the surprises are always surprising - and then BAM some misspelled word, or a typo, or some other easily repairable error suddenly takes my attention away from the narrative.

Issues: Nothing here made me particularly invested in either main character. Katie comes across as rather shallow and clueless, though we are TOLD she is kind and intelligent.

The plan backfires, as George refuses to further line their pockets, and he treats Cecilia like a princess.

890,4,ANQ7TQBXHMBY7,B0099E17MI,"I love Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series, and have recently become a fan of the Five Hundred Kingdoms books despite my reluctance to start reading yet another rewritten fairy tale - but I ended up buying one by accident (it wasn't listed as being a part of the series) and was so well pleased with it that I purchased all the other available books in the series.
This isn't just a rewrite of a fairy tale (or in this case a myth) to make it into another version of the same thing - this is a series of books written in a world view that is uniquely driven by The Tradition (a force that is both natural and magical, which attempts to create the circumstances that ensure stories follow the templates expected, stories acted out by the people that live in the various kingdoms of this world). People can move between kingdoms, and in each kingdom The Tradition is a little bit different or, in some cases, a LOT different. Therefore, the fairy tales become intermingled with stories from a variety of backgrounds, and the books are therefore anything but a cookie cutter repeat of the fairy tales (myth in this case) they get their starting point from. This particular story is rooted in ancient mythology and involves gods and goddesses, with a few interesting twists and a new perspective on what was once a very different story, but The Tradition is not well explained.
While each book in the series builds on material from previous installments, they are usually easily stand alone books. The first one I read was from somewhere in the middle of the series, and mentioned characters or activities from earlier installments, but I didn't realize it until I read the earlier books. Later ones seem to mention more from the earliest ones, but not enough that you would be lost if you read the last one first.
This particular story is not as easily a stand alone story  it is too short (having come from an anthology originally it was limited in length), and has minor characters from a previous book called ""The Sleeping Beauty"" as very central characters here; and, unfortunately, understanding the world view before you read it is important to understanding the combination of the material. But if you aren't inhibited by not having the background, it is fine all alone  I don't think I would have liked it as much as a separate purchase if I hadnt already read earlier books in the series. If you buy the other books in the series, this one would follow after ""The Sleeping Beauty"" book, but can be read anywhere after that one as the only characters it calls on from previous books are from that one.
I would like to see this fleshed out and finished up as a full length book. As a shorter story it has to leave out too much, whereas if it were a full-length book those lacks could be better addressed. All the same - well written as I always expect from Mercedes Lackey.",I love Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series,2,2016-08-10
891,4,A18B0T2O25SFT9,B0099LPCWC,"Breezy (Breanne) Jones is a 28-year-old meteorologist who is the weathergirl for he news team at KWAC TV in Aspen Grove, California. She's literally grown up in the newsroom there, as the previous weathercaster was her father. The community loves her sweet, girl-next-door style of delivering the news and she loves the community back, with no desire to ever live elsewhere. She already has her dream job here.

Noah Drake becomes the new station manager when KWAC is sold. He and his assistant general manager, Gabe Weston, have a reputation that has earned them the nickname ""The Firing Squad."" Breezy, the eternal optimist, is determined to remain positive... until she overhears him referring to her as ""Pollyanna"" in the most negative sense of the term.

The Pride and Prejudice parallels are obvious, especially when the sexy Pamela Gladstone (Hurricane Pamela) shows up with a very Caroline Bingley-like attitude toward the ""peasants"" she works with, aside from Noah. Breezy's mother is quite Mrs. Bennet-like in her desire to see her daughter married. However, this book also deviates significantly from P&P, so there's no predicting exactly how things will play out.

There are a couple of homonym-type misspellings (born/borne and another one or two others I can't specifically recall), but otherwise the writing is quite good. Ms. Horrocks does a nice job of creating a hometown feeling in Aspen Grove; the reader gets a Bedford Falls (It's A Wonderful Life) sense about the place.

She introduces a number of characters who will obviously continue throughout this series of books. Unfortunately, many of them don't figure much into this plot, and there are too many to remember if you're reading this as a stand-alone.

Among the stand-out supporting players here: Andrew North is a surfer-dude who's Breezy's ex-boyfriend. Candy Kane(!!) is proprietor of Candy's Cafe hosting Chick Flick Clique movie nights every Wednesday with Breezy and her friends.

I really like the dynamics between Noah and Breezy. There's a nice spark between them, both in their conversations and physically. She's immediately attracted to him and often struggles to maintain her dislike for him personally despite her abhorrence for what he's doing to her beloved news office. Meanwhile, Noah quickly recognizes that he underestimated Breezy and that he'd REALLY like to go out with her. He hates having Pamela around poisoning the work atmosphere at the station, but his hands are tied by the firm directives of the station owner, Mr. Bentley.

I do find it hard to believe that Noah would interview any of his employees, and surely not an on-air personality, without thoroughly reviewing their HR files. Instead, Breezy's qualifications surprise him, which is ridiculous. The author could achieve the same effect sticking to Breezy's much-younger-than-her-age appearance and her unsophisticated approach to delivering the news.

Onerall, this book has a very pleasant, wholesome quality. Content is clean and Biblical-type morals are demonstrated, yet there are glimpses of the darker side of humanity in the real world. Despite its flaws, I really liked it.","Pleasant, wholesome, modern Pride and Prejudice",3,2018-01-07

1.  You catch your husband cheating and find out  that he has had sex with almost everyone you know including your sister.  For 8 years you never had a clue?

2.  You empty your joint account and run off to Chicago on the bus with $20,000 IN CASH!!!!

3.  You spend $4,000 on clothes in one day.

4.  You hire a divorce lawyer who says you should let your CHEATING husband have the HOUSE, the CAR and all your other ASSETS.  What kind of stupid lawyer is this?  How dumb would you have to be to think this was a good idea?

5.  So now you have $16,000 minus hotel costs, legal fees, makeover, spa costs, flight to Rome and hotel in Rome.  Hmmmm...  Assuming the lawyer is a couple grand, maybe $12,000?  And you have no job?

6.  Instead of using a credit card, debit card or traveler's cheques, you carry all the cash with you!  Some in your carry on and some in your checked luggage.  Are you kidding me?  'Cause no one has ever had lost or stolen luggage.

7.  Fast forward to your first sexual encounter with a guy you met a few hours ago.  You IMMEDIATELY tell him you are on the pill.  He immediately lets you know that he is clean and is checked regularly.  OMG!!!!  Slide a CONDOM on that thing!

This is too immature for anyone who has stopped reading Archie comics.  If it's meant for a younger audience it is a what not to do manual.

Romancing Wisconsin Series Book 1
This series is about Love finding a way to bloom in Wisconsin during any season.
Christmas in July at a zoo for Eric Riley and Marissa Wilder who are both single parents and both have a daughter the same age. Reese Riley and Heather Wilder have met recently and hit it off 100%. Marissas day had not started off in the best way. Eric was supposed to be with the children however he got interrupted on his way to the school by an automobile accident. He saved a mans life. First she thinks of Eric as a no show dad but once she hears the reason she changes her mind. Eric does not bring up the fact he was at the accident since he does not like to brag. vvSo Marissa was filling in on this class trip for him. She had heels on as she was not expecting to walk around the zoo. She ended up hurting her ankle when the heel on her shoe got stuck between 2 boards. Eric being a paramedic checked out her ankle. She got a ride in a golf cart that was done up in Christmas things, candy cane and holly boughs and even a mistletoe and a driver that looked like Santa. Reese reminded her dad that the rule is if you're under the mistletoe you have to kiss.  Santa would not move till they did. He is quite the match maker. The Summer Santa was dressed in red boxer shorts and matching flip-flops. Santa had a way for Marissa to get an x-ray without a trip to the hospital, after all the zoo had one for x-rays they needed for animals.
Eric is impressed by her making an alphabet score sheet for the girls to fill out about the animals they see. Both Eric and Marissa had their own stories but they sure were two people worthy of finding love again.
Later Marissa is impressed with the wood working that Eric does. He has a military back ground also.
I won't spoil anymore about the story of Santa Butchs tricks and also Eric, Marissa, Reese and Heather.
Could not wait to read more books of the series to learn more about Santa Butch, his wife Judy, and the Riley family!

First, lets talk about a huge plot hole. John didn't know his wife was alive, yet somehow at the end of the book her guards betrayed her?  And all of a sudden John knew she was alive. Yeah, lets just brush over everything else that happened and the surprise at seeing his wife alive after breaking into Cams mind.

Lewis cant remember anything but they can share memories and she doesnt share them so he can at least have some of his life back? But his heart remembered her. Bleh.

The end was so anticlimactic. Everyone knew everything that was going to happen, but just decided it wasn't a good idea to let key players in on the plan? I mean com on!

I missed you, he whispered, his voice catching.

It is an exciting adventure that follows the expanding friendship of two boys from opposite tribes, one being a Highlander and the other a Lowlander. It is comical how the young boys fuss at each other, as only young boys can do, to show how ""big"" they are. This novel will grab your attention and keep you reading well into the night.

Kuini and Coyotl, who meet accidentally, are from different backgrounds and social statuses. Coyotl is the son of the Emperor of his tribe while Kuini is the son of a War Leader of his tribe. They learn and share with each other about their tribes ways of doing all things. Kuini, who is an excellent artist, learns to read with the help of Coyotl. When Kuini finds himself in Coyotl's noble world, he finds danger at every corner, especially when Kuini meets and falls in love with Coyotl's sister, Iztac. Customs demand that the two lovers may never see each other again after the girl is married to a husband she does not want, just so her father can appease the leader of another tribe.

This novel is extremely well written as only Zoe Saadia can do. Her research is very apparent as you go from pyramids, to temples, to palaces. This novel is rich in historical detail.

925,3,A1JOZFD5CCXEBF,B009FN1DA4,"One of the things for which San Francisco is famous is its sourdough bread.  Unlike other breads, each loaf must contain a starter, a piece of dough that has been cultured for many years.  There are differences between various cultures and a lot of competition to have the best one.  Enough competition to kill for.
 That is what happens in THE SOURDOUGH WARS.  One of the best sourdough bakeries closed when the owner died and his children fought over what to do with the starter.  The daughter, Anita, wanted the bakery.  She got the house.  The son, Peter, wanted the house.  He got the bakery.
 Awhile later, a theater group with which Peter was involved was trying to stay in business.  Someone suggested auctioning of the starter to raise funds for the project.  There were four potential buyers: Two feuding brothers from the San Francisco area, each of whom had a bakery specializing in sourdough, a woman from the area who had a small, independent bakery and, possibly, the best sourdough bread in the area, and an out-of-towner who represented a large corporation.  While the quartet waited and waited and waited for the auction to begin, Peter didn't show up.  He had been murdered.
 Each of the four members of the group may have had a reason to kill him.  So did Anita.  Rebecca Schwartz, a  Jewish feminist lawyer who was helping with the auction, suddenly became one of those trying to find the murderer.
 One of the main complications of solving the crime was the interference of a reporter who was determined to get the story first. Reporters never seem to care what kind of chaos is unleashed as a result of their handiwork; every day they open a new and different Pandoras Box and don't give a damn about the consequences.
 There is a common thread throughout the story: parental favoritism.  How parents, and others, view a person, does have a lasting effect on how they live their lives.  It often drives a wedge between siblings.  As Anita stated, I really hated him, you know that?  I wanted to humiliate him the way my parents humiliated meI wanted to show him up as incompetent.  So you know what I did?  I let it get in my way.  If Id offered him decent money for the starter, hed have sold it to me and wed both have been happy, but I had to control him into the bargain.
 Revenge may not be the most uplifting theme of the human psyche, but it can be comforting sometimes.
 Author Julie Smith uses humor and witty dialogue throughout the story.  Near the beginning, she wrote, Its just one of those ineffable things said Mickey.  That was the way she usually handled Kruzickby using words he couldn't understand.
 Other examples are Over the bridge and through Marin, to Sallys place we went. and, in response to a two short sentence dialogue:  Supplying the third line of a rhyming triplet.  I had to go back and reread it.  I had missed the rhyming.
 There is a thorough explanation of the history of sourdough: What it is.  How it got to San Francisco.  Why its important.
 The book was published in 1984.  I would hope there would be some changes now to reflect changing social awareness.  She was ahead of her time on her attitude toward the gay community but her stereotypical descriptions of her Jewish mother were offensive.  Besides her caricature of a mother, Rebecca was Jewish had nothing to do with the story. She isn't observant when she briefly describes eating shellfish, definitely not kosher.

931,5,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009G1WQB0,"Author Peggy A. Edelheit has managed (in a writing range that is solid) to create what every author of romance adventures wants  a character so balanced and so real that all who read her series (of which this is book 5) end up saying Everybody loves Samantha1. Samantha Jamison is an author/sleuth and it is because of her well-sculpted personality that she manages to attract every one who comes across the good fortune of reading either all or some of this series.

Peggy jump starts this 5th book of the Samantha Jamison Mysteries  MOUTH OF THE RAT   with her own vigor that revs up the story and explains the title: The meaning of the name Boca Raton has always aroused curiosity. Many people wrongly assume the name is simply Rats Mouth. The Spanish word boca, or mouth, often describes an inlet, while raton means, literally, mouse. The term Boca de Ratones
 or Boca Ratones was a navigational, referring to a rocky or jagged inlet, but the original location of Boca de Ratones was Biscayne Bay near present-day Miami Beach, according to eighteenth century maps. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the term was mistakenly applied to the current Lake Boca Raton, whose inlet was closed throughout most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The s and later the  e were dropped from this title by the 1920s, yet the correct pronunciation remains Rah-tone. Very typical of Peggys respect for her audience to include information such as this  and a fine springboard for her mystery.

It is that kind of background early on in her books that makes Peggys Samantha books sparkle. Add to the romantic and physical aspects some very well considered mystery development and you have another terrific outing with our favorite author/sleuth. Oh yes, a hint of where Samantha is going in this edition - Mona is frantic. ""Marco is dead! Come quick!"" Who's Marco? I had a week to solve it, but began to think it was unsolvable. It involved murder, drugs, an ex-wife, and an antique car collection. Who did it? Male/Female?.

Sammie becomes more involved with Nick than she would like, but he's next to impossible to resist. She has plans to leave the country soon and tries to break it off with Nick more than once.

941,5,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B009LNKB4C,"I loved this story.  This hero is one SEXY guy.  I will be willing to bet that as a kid he played Doctor!!!  An OB/GYN doctor.  This is one sexed up man!!!  You will love him!!!  He had a rough childhood, doing great as an adult and then out of the blue he discovers his life is not as he thought it was.  Personally, I would have been glad to find out that the family I had really was no kin!!!  But, it is a great story of discovery, love, mystery, and of course a HEA.

I really liked it.  One reviewer had a problem with the passport section and I kept waiting for that to be a big part of the story.  It wasn't for me.  I love the NZ writers, they have sexy heroes, strong heroines, and a good description of the setting around them.  I have added NZ to my bucket list.  These stories make me want to go there.  Great story, I loved it and I highly recommend it.  It is a SEXY story so if that is a problem for you, pass on this one.  If it is not a problem be sure to crank the A/C down and enjoy!!!

My usual genre is murder mysyteries or courtroom dramas, but I was in the the mood for something different; I'm so glad I chose this book. I easily related to both main characters despite their age difference, and could see myself wondering the shops and streets in Rainbow Village.

943,1,A1D2YFF7MYK2BZ,B009M9MILE,"This had some good thoughts in places but it got very long and I ended up hating it. I stuck with it to the bitter end just to see how it ended, and I'm thankful it's over. Now I'm putting Annie Katz on my ""Never Read Again"" list and if you care to know why, read on and I'll tell you. Note: SPOILERS AHEAD

I actually made it through all of the Mother Earth, Dream Mother, Mother Ocean, Mother Sky, Mother Food, Pray To Everything, and so-on without too much pain, though the author sure had all the New Age stuff down pat.  But still I was kind of caught up in the story. Then I reached the 75% point and suddenly the book had nearly every anti-gun talking point constantly spouted by the professional gun haters. Here are some examples:

""The more paranoid a person is, the more he needs weapons and shield, and the more dangerous he is to himself and others. The most courageous among us need no weapons, no shields."" Location 4015

""Maybe that's why people carry guns around,"" she said. ""To scare the rest of us or to make us think they are powerful, that they could do anything they want because they have a gun and we don't.""  Location 4010

""I'd rather make peace than war. Especially with paranoid folks who love guns.""  Location 4023

""...we were talking about fearful people needing guns to feel safer."" Location 4180

""...a reminder of how dangerous guns are.""  Location 4712

And of course after writing a column on guns, a drunken gun owner shot up her barber shop. Now her first draft - printed in full in the book - clearly showed her bias against guns, but in all fairness, the actual column Lila put in the newspaper was not bad. As she said, ""I wanted to stress meeting, not stress my personal bias about handguns."" (Location 4465)

But since all gun owners are evil, stupid or drunken bums, the author HAD to have one overreact. Otherwise people might not understand that guns = bad!

And also of course at the town meeting, a whole bus of gun owners showed up. It was ""...full of men from a gun club. Not one woman was on the bus.""  Cause only men could be dumb enough to want a gun. And of course those gun guy bullies monopolized the meeting and interrupted and intimidated anyone who tried to talk.

I found the last one-fourth of the book to be openly biased against lawful gun ownership and cannot recommend it to anyone.",Flagrant Anti-Gun Propaganda,5,2017-07-07
944,3,A3NILSED8WXNFS,B009M9MILE,"Like so many of the books on Amazon, this one is not in the right category. I bought it because it was listed as literary fiction, which generally appeals to an adult or young adult audience.  Lila Blue is  most definitely a Middle Grade book as the protagonist is only twelve.  Because the story targets younger readers, the novel presents a few problems.  First, it is too long.  I know of few high schoolers who would stay engaged in this story for its entirety, much less middle grade students.  Second, the novel is a collection of loosely connected stories that don't seem to be tightly tied to a theme or a purpose.  Finally, much of the book lets the reader figure out the point, which isn't consistent with the age level targeted.  For example, many of the truisms of Lila are left hanging, without a real clarity about their purpose or meaning. So  I think the author is writing on one level and targeting an audience on another.
However, I do like the characters and the setting. Also, I think the premise is a good one, and  there are solid lessons to be learned from Cassandra's grandmother.  I just wish the writing wasn't so lofty as to miss the audience who could benefit the most from it.",Out of reach...,4,2016-12-14

In that regard this tome is no juvenile accomplishment, whatever the intended audience. Not a great many novels lands in my to- be- re-read column. This is one such. No wonder it has also landed a five star rating from me. I was also pleased with the ending, a feature which tends to certify or diminish a reader's satisfaction no matter how commendable the toil of the author's whole ocean of work preceding this horizon.

960,4,A264UDLWWRJ7X4,B009R7M7OE,"An intricately-plotted fast-paced romantic romp that takes place over the course of one madcap day, this novel really delivers.

On the day before her wedding to Jake, our heroine, Rennie, seeks out her ex-boyfriend, Con, to confess in person that his grandmother has been swindled while under Rennie's care.  From this simple beginning, this talented author spins a tale that encompasses con men, gangsters, ambitious news reporters, stoner hotel staff, a day spa that turns into a brothel at night, and a ""health mine"" where tourists pay to enter an abandoned gold mine to sit in lichen slime and breathe radon gas.

The cast of characters includes a former teen grifter trying to stay straight, a super rich game designer who can't seem to help seeing life in terms of competition, a prissy con man who wears ""man makeup,"" and a mob enforcer who is in the market for a nice diamond ring for his wife.  The love triangle between Rennie, Con and Jake is funny and engaging.  Despite the importance of the twisty-turny plot, these are all three-dimensional characters with fascinating backstories and realistic character traits.

The author does tend to do some head-hopping in her narration, so it is sometimes hard for the reader to figure out which character's head they are in.  But the author has a flare for witty dialogue that can be really funny.

This was a fast-paced, edge of your seat kind of crime/mystery. The action and suspense just kept coming! Every time I sat down to read, it was for longer than I intended.  Bailey and Guy, the main characters, are likeable and have real flaws, not stereotypical as you find in many stories. I could not predict how they would handle situations which made them believable. The author took her time to build credible relationships and unfold the plot. There were plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing.
Guy, a private detective, is hired by an adoptive relative to find her long, lost granddaughter Cassidy, who was kidnapped at birth. Bailey finds out from Guy, after the woman she thought was her mother dies, that she has been living a lie. Not even her name is real. No one is as they seem and she is not sure who she can trust. Instead of living the luxurious life of the wealthy young heiress she should have been entitled, her childhood was poverty and moving from town to town, scrounging the streets with the woman she called mother to survive. Her reappearance spells disastrous consequences for two very powerful and dangerous men who will stop at nothing to make her disappear.

It was nice not to have to cope with Reed's sweating and his constant and overwhelming social insecurity being larger characters than Billie.

975,1,A1HBTW5M7ZZ9PT,B009Y3ON4I,"This is one of those rare books I'm DNFng, but I wish I wasn't. Let me explain. I love Ransom Riggs, along with his wife Tahereh Mafi; I feel they're an amazing couple, extremely talented, and just good people. Because of this, I tend to unfailingly fangirl for them; meaning, I may hype them up without seeing enough literature to hype them up reasonably.

Before this book, I'd only read Ransom's Ms. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children; even then, it was on Audible. I loved it and even bought the paperback recently, so I could have the full set of the series. Well, I'm abandoning this series, so a full set will most likely never be had, but I had said all this to say this; it's important to see authors as their writing, not just their awesome personality and happenstance of being a writer.

Which leads me to my review of this book.

Hollow City picks up immediately after the events of Ms. Peregrine's. Since this is the case, I assumed this book would be just as amazing as the first; it would set the tone, be engaging (if slow), and would build a slow creepiness. After 200+ pages of this book, putting it on hold twice, and telling myself I'd reward myself with Tales of the Peculiar if I finished this book, I know it's just a dud for me.

Hollow City is, quite literally, one of the most uneventful books I've ever read in my life. You see, there are things that happen in this book; many things that fall in direct line with deus ex machina, but they aren't interesting. We see the children almost get killed, we see talking animals (I can't even get started on this one; this post would be way too long), and we see that this supposedly fast-paced book is without a plot.

Because, in my opinion, going on a search to turn Ms. Peregrine back into a human isn't a plot.

No, it really isn't. A plot, for me, is something that involves character growth; something that deepens the characters in the first book, molds them, and shows who they really are. In this book, we simply get character approved sayings, descriptions, and Jacob being insecure in place of real substance. There's nothing here.

I'm actually reminded of Lawrence of Arabia...

There is nothing in this book and no man needs nothing.

We meet talking wights, typical hollowgasts, Jacob continuing to be weak, Emma being bossy, Bronwyn being a bad bitch, Olive being adorable, Hugh being amazing, Horace being annoying, and Willard being the only one I can truly stomach any day of the week. I'm so disappointed in this book; especially considering it took supposedly three years to write. To me, this means the author may have been dealing with writer's block...not working to create a masterpiece.

To avoid whining further, I'm going to stop my review after this paragraph. This book could've been something beautiful and amazing; something to do the first book justice, but it doesn't. Instead, we get a gimmicky book that seems mostly circumstantial and not...whole. We see characters reacting in ways the author feels they should be; not as the characters would.

In a word, this book makes me sad.",A let down.,10,2016-11-06
976,2,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B009Y3ON4I,"2.5 Stars. The first book of Miss Peregrine didn't blow me away, but it had enough potential that I wanted to continue the story. Unfortunately, the second book failed to do so. Hollow City reminded me a lot of the first half of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  a lot of moving around avoiding bad guys with very little progress. For HP, that was okay because readers were brought to that point by 6 books of character development and exciting stories. Almost the entirety of Hollow City follows the children, that we hardly know, on the run from wights.

I read the first 50 pages of this book and then put it down for a couple weeks because it just didn't pull me in. When I finally got back to it, I realized why - the photographs. Including weird vintage photos was a cool concept in the first book, inspiring some delightful characters. However, it becomes extremely limiting here. The author forces the narrative around the photos instead of around his protagonists. This means a lot of random encounters that don't progress the plot, but allow another photo to be included. Thatd be okay if there was some character development, but there isnt. Its mostly a cat and mouse game until the very end when the story is finally given some meat (and the focus narrows to Jacob & Emma).

Overall, I thought this was a disappointment  a bridge book meant to stretch a thin story even further. Readers can simply read the last 3-4 chapters and have all they need to go into the next book. Ill read the last book because Im curious to see where Jacob ends up, but I truly hope the author focuses on his protagonists and not the strange photos.

Final note: Usually I keep my reviews to the content of a book, but these deserve a little extra recognition. The hardcover editions of these books are really beautiful. The paper is thicker than standard, with small embellishments to the design and the size is a bit more compact. They have a weight to them that underlies excellent quality. I wish more books came this well done.",A bridge book to stretch the story into an unnecessary trilogy,7,2016-09-20
977,5,A6BVIM99OIP3X,B009Y3ON4I,"If you're trying to decide if this series is worth continuing to read the answer is yes! This second book picked up right where the first book ends. This is non stop. Never a dull moment. Lots of information about Peculiars  and their peculiar world! We meet a few new amazingly imagined peculiars as well.  I love how the pictures fall into place with the story. I find myself wondering if the pictures are found for the storyline or the storyline is built around the pictures.
This series is very different, brilliantly imaginative and quite peculiar! I'm really finding myself connecting with all of the characters. They are so intriguing. I am loving seeing Jacob's peculiarities start to take shape and am very anxious to read the final book.
This series has been very unique. The ending. WOW I was not expecting that. It has me hooked and I definitely won't be able to go on without knowing how this all ends.",Absolutely captivating.,7,2016-09-04
978,5,A2B3TENUQHOVBK,B009Y3ON4I,"Altho written as if for the young adult, us older adults will love the book just as much, This is not the retelling of an old story line but a new fresh look at what goes bump in the night and what we wonder about when all alone in the middle of the night. New characters - the peculiar children and their leaders (the headmistresses) will delight and entertain you throughout the book. Fast paced and well written. A bit over priced but that is probably due to the movie coming out soon...",Peculiar Children,2,2016-03-16
979,4,A7VNF0SRD0VMC,B009Y3ON4I,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was an excellent first novel. Of course it had its limitations and growing pains of a fledgling book, but I appreciated the new story and unusual gang of characters. There is a sideshow, vaudeville theme combined with creepy photos from history. The main character is dealing with tragedy and new found extraordinary life. Young adults, of a sort, coming of age, of a sort (oooo--mystery), while they travel across South England. These ragamuffins are actually quite endearing. The second book is even quite the improvement on the first gaining it an easy 4.5 stars.

This is not a horror story; this is not a pee-your-pants, bone-tingler; this is not for those who wish to shut the book in the freezer. Perhaps for this reason the books have been getting a mix of praise and abysmal reviews. Know what you are reading before you rate it in the trash bin. The book is about a group of teenagers. If you expected it to be anything but a tad bit creepy and chock full of odd, then shame on you.

The adventure continues on directly where the last book left off. This beginning is not made to just walk right into; you will need to read the first novel to understand the plight the children find themselves facing. As the story develops, we get to meet even more peculiar children and even a few peculiar animals, and the pacing for the whole plot is quite right. There is a deadline to this story, and we are certainly pushed along (while also getting to enjoy the scenery). The writing develops quite nicely in this sophomore novel as well as the plot. I can really feel this author getting his feet under him.

The book abruptly ends as with the first novel. The story itself is wrapped up nicely, but we are then presented with so many new questions. Excellent form of cliffhanger. I look forward to the third novel.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was an excellent first novel,7,2016-03-13
980,5,A192J6UGVTGV27,B009Y3ON4I,"Just as good, or better, as the first book! I can't believe how much I am loving this series. Hollow City had a faster pace and more action, lots of mysteries being unraveled. The ending left me smiling ear to ear with anticipation for Library of Souls, which I bought ahead of time and am about to dive right into!","Just as good, or better",4,2016-02-19
981,3,A2IZ2NUGDV43BI,B009Y9OEDM,"I rarely read a book with so few reviews, even if it free, but the sample was so well written, it sucked me in as I imagined myself in Alannys' place.  Mostly I liked it, but there are places where I rolled my eyes and skimmed. There were times I found myself thinking ""Reeeeallyyy?  Seriously??""  Great portions are really good, but often bogs down in conversations.  Ms. Miller writes conversations mostly very well, but too many times I felt we could get the same information with in half the pages.

What I loved:  I'm a musician and a music teacher, I teach k-12, and I'm a vocalist.  I can confirm  Alannys' job situation is sadly all too real.  Those of us with administrators that support (non-marching band) fine arts are the lucky ones.  The premise of art being power and a song can break the world--I mean, what musician wouldn't jump at that?  Especially in Alannys' situation?  Oh, yes, please, sign me up!

What I did not love/got on my nerves:  I wish Alannys would decide what she's going to do and to be.  One minute she's using her brain, the next she's a wimp.  One minute she wants the truth, the next she wants to ""hide from it as long as I can"".  She goes to great lengths to retrieve her violin, yet once she does, we never see it again?  Whats up with that?

And shes not the only one.  In one moment, another character suddenly goes from blinding murderous rage to compliantly preaching tolerance.  Boom.  Just like that.  Reeeeallyyy?

I am intrigued just enough to perhaps give the next one a go.  Maybe.","There is much potential here, and I wanted very badly to love it.",15,2016-03-08

983,1,A3J6U1ZDYHZEWO,B009Y9OEDM,"Normally I do not write a review unless  I feel the book is a four or greater

The only time I will review a book that is a one is if it is wasted my time and is full of vulgar material F bombs and similar lewd content

Technically the characters are weak the plot is all over the place all Male characters, heroes included, are emasculated, mentally weak, and portrayed as emotional Simps.

The way the characters meander through the story is both mentally frustrating and depressingly unbelievable.

The best thing I can say about this book is it has a pretty girl on the front cover

This book is less than one star and I highly discourage anyone from wasting their time with it

It appears to be book one in the series but if this is the first and is indicative of those that follow I give a warning to run away

985,4,A2U3BSRZFY3M6B,B009YLKRAO,"Rebekkah Franck has a nose for news and really bad taste in men. Here is a novel whose tautly crafted plot is the skeleton upon which the characters provide all the meat that is necessary to tell the story. THREE, FOUR is gristly and raw, and lends itself to my metaphor quite nicely.

When you see the titles in the Rebekkah Franck series, you immediately start singing the old nursery rhyme One, two buckle my shoe; three four close the door, and so on. The titles also let you know that you are reading the books in the right order. There is enough continuity in this, the second book, for me to appreciate having read the first in the series. On the other hand, it is possible to pick this one up and get enough background while turning the pages to see what comes next.

For me, a good series needs a good back story. I often wait until it seems like there will be no new books added to a series so I can binge read them one after another. The back story needs to develop over time so that the characters do not stagnate. The back story here is both realistic and dynamic.

However, I found a lot of grammatical errors and realized the author Is not American because of the wording and phrasing.  If I had known this I would have been more accepting of the writing voice.  If there was supposed to be a surprise twist it was not there.  This was more a character study.  This was the first book I have read by Ms.  Rose.  I don't think I'll read another.

987,3,A2EHTR61HF7T6A,B009YLKRAO,"I don't remember seeing quite so many edit errors or omissions in the first of this series, but #2 by Willow Rose, a Rebekka Franck mystery, ""Three, Four...Better Lock Your Door,"" is peppered with them. The plot is rather predictable and easy to guess the antagonist, though this star reporter somehow misses all the clues. She's quick to reject her photographer, Sune, thinking of him as a boy while getting the hots for the more mature macho psycho killer. Maybe she's not as sharp as she's cracked up to be, but certainly as shallow. This sado-masochistic villain exudes a little Hitchcock and takes his revenge to a whole nother level. Rebekka writes her stories and uses Sune's photos while trying to reject him, singing praises of her editor one minute and denouncing him as demanding the next. Huh?

988,5,A112JRLN4F6ZYQ,B009YLKRAO,"This is the second book in the Rebekka Franck series. This book is about a serial killer who performs lobotomies on their victims, which is topical given the recent biography about Rosemary Kennedy. While a gruesome subject, the book is not particularly gory. I am learning that Willow Rose does not write the Agatha Christie type of mystery where there are a certain number of characters in a setting (boat, house party, small, close-knit neighborhood, etc.) and one of them is the killer for a reason hidden in the clues. Willow Rose's books seem more about telling an entertaining story, although in all of her mysteries that I have read to date, the killer is one of the secondary, sometimes peripheral, characters. One may guess the murderer, but it will be a guess, because the reason for the murders is unknown, although it has something loosely to do with the plot. If you want to be an armchair sleuth, these may not be your type of mystery, unless you want a particular challenge. However, if you want an enjoyable story full of twists and turns and an elegant plot, this is the book for you.","Really, Really Good",3,2016-01-23
